[{"title": "Admiral Grigorovich-Class (Project 11356 Class) Russian Frigate", "id": 2041, "json": {"tiers": [true, false, false, false], "notes": "Admiral Grigorovich-Class (Project 11356 Class) Russian Frigate is a class of frigates built by the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad for the Russian Navy. Based on the Talwar class, six ships were ordered for the Russian Black Sea Fleet under two contracts in 2010 and 2011 as a complement to the Admiral Gorshkov class frigates.\n\nBy 2010-2011, it was decided the Russian Navy will procure six vessels based on the proven Talwar class design, mainly due to repeated delays with the production of Admiral Gorshkov frigates and because of the urgent need for new frigates necessary for modernization of the Black Sea Fleet. The Yantar Shipyard won the contract for construction of the frigates and three vessels were to be completed in four years. Previously, six ships of the same design, known as Talwar class, were built for the Indian Navy between 1999 and 2011 by the Baltic Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, and Yantar Shipyard, Kaliningrad.\n\nThe lead ship, Admiral Grigorovich, was laid down on 18 December 2010 and was commissioned on 11 March 2016.\n\nInitially, Ukrainian state-owned enterprise Zorya-Mashproekt was providing gas turbines for the Russian frigates, but after the Ukrainian crisis, Ukraine said it would no longer supply the engines. Instead, Russian manufacturer, Saturn was asked to supply alternative M90FR gas turbines.\n\nSince October 2016, it was claimed the three incomplete frigates, Admiral Butakov, Admiral Istomin, and Admiral Kornilov, that construction was suspended in 2015 due to Ukraine's refusal to supply gas turbine power plants, are considered to be sold to India. The Russian Navy has opposed this export.\n\n\nOn 1 June 2017, the United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) announced that it would resume construction of the last three frigates in 2018 and that the ships will later join the Russian Navy. The decision to resume the work was made following the preliminary testing of the latest Russian gas turbine engines, the M70FRU (14 MW), M70FRU2 (6-8 MW), and M90FR (20 MW , maximal 25-28 MW), from the United Engine Corporation, built at NPO Saturn and TurboRus plants. With access to alternative power plants, the ships were believed to remain in Russian service.\n\nHowever, on 27 October 2018, India's Ministry of Defence and Russia signed a US$950 million deal for the delivery of two incomplete Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates to the Indian Navy. Reportedly, these are to be Admiral Butakov and Admiral Istomin frigates, previously being built for the Russian Navy.\n\nAs of February 2019, the last three vessels remain without engines.\n\nOn 3 November 2016, as part of Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War, Admiral Grigorivich was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for the first time. On 15 November 2016, it has launched a Kalibr cruise missile on IS and Al-Nusra targets in Syria's Idlib and Homs provinces, destroying ammunition warehouses, gathering and training centers, and weapon production plants.\n\nAdmiral Grigorivich was redeployed to the Mediterranean Sea in April 2017, following the US missile strikes against Syria.\n\nOn 20 November 2018, Rosoboronexport and Goa Shipyard signed a US$500 million deal for the construction of additional two Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates for the Indian Navy. The frigates are to be licensed-built at the Goa Shipyard in India under a technology transfer from Russia. The construction is expected to start in 2020, with the first vessel to be delivered in 2026 and the second in 2027.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2015, "countryOfOrigin": "Russia (RUS)", "proliferation": "India, Russian Federation", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["India", "Russian Federation"], "dis": {"name": "FFG ADMIRAL GRIGOROVICH PROJECT 11356M CLASS", "string": "01.03.222.006.013.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative designations", "value": "Admiral Grigorovich-Class; Project 11356P/M Class; Krivak IV"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Frigate"}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "6 ships scheduled to be built."}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Yantar Shipyard, Kaliningrad\nGoa Shipyard"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "200", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Aircraft Carried", "value": "1 \u00d7 Ka-27 series helicopter"}, {"name": "Aviation Facilities", "value": "Helipad and hangar for one helicopter"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "The Admiral Grigorovich class also referred to as Krivak IV class, Russian designation Project 11356\u0420/\u041c, is a class of frigates built by the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad for the Russian Navy.

The command module detects and tracks threats, distributes targeting data to the combat modules, and interrogates IFF of approaching threats. The command module has a 3-D target detection radar, and an all weather multi-band integrated control system. Depending on the number of installed combat modules, the system can engage multiple targets simultaneously. The combat modules automatically track using either radar, electro-optronic control system (such as FLIRs) or both, and then engages targets with missiles and guns. The combat modules are typically equipped with two GSh-30K (AO-18K) six-barrel 30 mm rotary cannons, fed by a link-less feeding mechanism, and two 9M311-1 missile launchers equipped with 4 ready-to-fire missiles each and fed by a reloading system storing 32 missiles in ready-to-launch containers.\n\nThe guns used in the Kortik are the GSh-30K six-barrel 30 mm rotary cannon. Individually, each GSh-30K has a higher rate of fire compared to other guns used by other CIWS such as the GAU-8 on the Goalkeeper and the M61 Vulcan on the Phalanx. Along with a high rate of fire, the fairly heavy round (390 g or 14 oz) used by the Kortik is comparable to the DPU rounds of the GAU-8 Avenger (425 g or 15.0 oz), although the muzzle velocity (and therefore both the kinetic energy and effective range) is slightly lower, partially offsetting the high caliber and rate of fire.\n\nThe missiles used in the Kortik are the 9M311 missiles, which is also used on the 9K22 Tunguska. The 9M311 is a SACLOS guided missile, however, it is steered automatically by the command module. The warhead weighs 9 kilograms (20 lb) and is either laser or radio fused. The warhead is a continuous-rod warhead with a steel cube fragmentation layer. The detonation of the warhead will form a complete circle of fragmentation that is 5 meters in radius, and damage or destroy anything in that circle.\n\nThe combination of the missiles and guns, provides more comprehensive protection when compared to other CIWS utilising either missiles or guns only.

It has a surface displacement estimated at about 115 long tons (117 tons). The Ghadir class is probably better described as a coastal or littoral submarine, similar in concept to the Italian Sauro class, though significantly smaller.\n\nThe Ghadir class is based on the North Korean Yono-class submarine. Photographs indicate a pair of bow torpedo tubes around 21 inches (530 mm) diameter, allowing them to fire typical heavyweight torpedoes. It could thus serve as a launch platform for the VA-111 Shkval rocket torpedo.\n\nOn 24 November 2007 Iranian rear-admiral Habibollah Sayyari announced: \"A homemade destroyer called Jamaran and a home-made submarine of Ghadir class will launch operation on November 28.\"  He also said that the submarine was equipped with the latest military and technological equipment and that its capabilities are equal to that of foreign types.

Azmat was commissioned on 24 April 2012 at Tianjin, China after being launched on 20 September 2011. It has the pennant number 1013.\n\nPNS Azmat is considered by many[citation needed] as a stealth boat, due to its hull and design, even though it was not so designed. The small fast attack craft is a green water vessel and does not have blue water capabilities, and so it is mostly used to patrol the coast, and to assist the Coast Guard in any special operations that require extensive firepower.\n\nPNS Azmat is equipped with eight C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles, carried in two quadruple missile containers. The vessel uses a fully automatic 23 mm gun. The decision to install the 23 mm gun was due to lack of hull space, which meant less storage area for 75-100 mm rounds required for larger guns and weight requirements. Also a 23 mm gun is much easier to maintain than larger 75 mm to 100 mm guns. For its defensive capabilities, Azmat uses a CIWS.

Referred to as \"projection and command ships\" (French: b\u00e2timents de projection et de commandement or BPC), a Mistral-class ship is capable of transporting and deploying 16 NH90 or Tiger helicopters, four landing barges, up to 70 vehicles including 13 AMX Leclerc tanks, or a 40-strong Leclerc tank battalion, and 450 soldiers. The ships are equipped with a 69-bed hospital and are capable of serving as part of a NATO Response Force, or with United Nations or European Union peace-keeping forces.\n\nThree ships of the class are in service in the French Navy: Mistral, Tonnerre, and Dixmude. A deal for two ships for the Russian Navy was announced by then French President Nicolas Sarkozy on 24 December 2010, and signed by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin and French Defence Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 in the presence of Sarkozy on 25 January 2011. On 3 September 2014, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced the postponement of delivery of the first warship, Vladivostok, due to the Russia\u2013Ukraine crisis. On 5 August 2015, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that France would pay back payments and keep the two ships initially produced for the Russian Navy; the two ships were later sold to Egypt.\n\nBased on displacement tonnage, Mistral and Tonnerre are the largest ships in the French Navy after the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, for roughly the same height above the water.\n\nAviation\nThe flight deck of each ship is approximately 6,400 square meters (69,000 sq ft). The deck has six helicopter landing spots, one of which is capable of supporting a 33-tonne helicopter. The 1,800-square-metre (19,000 sq ft) hangar deck can hold 16 helicopters and includes a maintenance area with an overhead crane. To aid launch and recovery, a DRBN-38A Decca Bridgemaster E250 landing radar and an Optical Landing System are used.\nThe flight and hangar decks are connected by two aircraft lifts, each capable of lifting 13 tonnes. The 225-square-meter (2,420 sq ft) main lift is located near the stern of the ship, on the centreline, and is large enough for helicopters to be moved with their rotors in flight configuration. The 120 square meters (1,300 sq ft) auxiliary lift is located aft of the island superstructure.\n\nEvery helicopter operated by the French military is capable of flying from these ships. On 8 February 2005, a Westland Lynx of the Navy and a Cougar landed on Mistral. The first landing of a NH90 took place on 9 March 2006. Half of the air group of the BPCs is to be constituted of NH-90s, the other half being composed of Tigre attack helicopters. On 19 April 2007, Puma, \u00c9cureuil, and Panther helicopters landed on Tonnerre. On 10 May 2007, a MH-53E Sea Dragon of the US Navy landed on her reinforced helicopter spot off the U.S. Naval Station Norfolk.\n\nAccording to Mistral's first commanding officer, Capitaine de vaisseau Gilles Humeau, the size of the flight and hangar decks would allow the operation of up to thirty helicopters.\n\nMistral aviation capabilities approach those of the Wasp-class amphibious assault ships, for roughly 40% of the cost and crew requirements of the American ship.\n\nAmphibious transport\nMistral-class ships can accommodate up to 450 soldiers, although this can be doubled for short-term deployments. The 2,650-square-metre (28,500 sq ft) vehicle hangar can carry a 40-strong Leclerc tank battalion, or a 13-strong Leclerc tank company, and 46 other vehicles. By comparison, Foudre-class ships can carry up to 100 vehicles, including 22 AMX-30 tanks, in the significantly smaller 1,000-square-metre (11,000 sq ft) deck. The 885-square-meter (9,530 sq ft) well deck can accommodate four landing craft. The ships are capable of operating two LCAC hovercraft, and although the French Navy appears to have no intention of purchasing any LCACs, this capability improves the class's ability to interoperate with the United States Marine Corps and the British Royal Navy. Instead, the DGA ordered eight French-designed 59-tonne EDA-R catamarans.\n\nCommand and communications\nMistral-class ships can be used as command and control ships, with an 850-square-meter (9,100 sq ft) command center which can host up to 150 personnel. Information from the ship's sensors is centralized in the SENIT system (Syst\u00e8me d'Exploitation Navale des Informations Tactiques, \"System for Naval Usage of Tactical Information\"), a derivative of the US Navy's Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS). Problems in the development of the SENIT 9 revision contributed to the one-year delay in the delivery of the two ships. SENIT 9 is based around Thales' tri-dimensional MRR3D-NG Multi-Role Radar, which operates on the C band and incorporates IFF capabilities. SENIT 9 can also be connected to NATO data exchange formats through Link 11, Link 16, and Link 22. For communications, the Mistral-class ships use the SYRACUSE satellite system, based on French satellites SYRACUSE 3-A and SYRACUSE 3-B which provide 45% of the Super High Frequency secured communications of NATO. From 18 to 24 June 2007, a secure video conference was held twice a day between Tonnerre, then sailing from Brazil to South Africa, and VIP visitors at the Paris Air Show.\n\nArmament\nAs of 2008, the two Mistral-class ships were armed with two Simbad launchers for Mistral missiles and four 12.7 mm M2-HB Browning machine guns. Two Breda-Mauser 30 mm/70 guns are also included in the design, though not installed as of 2009.\n\nIncidents such as the near-loss of the Israeli corvette INS Hanit to a Hezbollah-fired anti-ship missile during the 2006 Lebanon War have shown the vulnerability of modern warships to asymmetric threats, with the Mistral-class ships considered under-equipped for self-defense in such a situation. Consequently, Mistral and Tonnerre cannot be deployed into hostile waters without sufficient escorting ships. This problem is compounded by the small number of escort ships in the French Navy; there is a five-year gap between the decommissioning of the Suffren-class frigates and the commissioning of their replacements, the Horizon-class and FREMM frigates.\n\nFollowing the experiences of French naval commanders during Op\u00e9ration Baliste, the French deployment to aid European citizens in Lebanon during the 2006 war, proposals to improve the self-defense capabilities of the two Mistral-class ships were supported by one of the French chiefs of staff, and are under active consideration as of 2008. One suggestion is to upgrade the dual-launching, manual Simbad launchers to quadruple-launching, automatic Tetral launchers.\n\nIn December 2014, the French Navy awarded a contract to Airbus to study the integration of the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) with Mistrals. This is an attempt to increase the ships' naval fire support capabilities, as current 76 mm and 100 mm guns have been determined to have insufficient range and lethality for the role. The MLRS is in service with the French Army, using a GPS-guided rocket with a range of 70 km (43 mi) and a unitary 90 kg (200 lb) high-explosive warhead.\n\nIn late 2013 The French Navy equipped all three Mistral \"BPC\" ships with two M134 Miniguns each; intended for close-in self-defense against asymmetric threats faced during anti-piracy operations, such as speedboats and kamikaze boats.\n\nIn late 2011, the French Navy selected the NARWHAL20 remote weapon station (RWS) to equip Mistral ships for close-in self-defense. Nexter Systems will deliver two NARWHAL20B guns for each ship, chambered in 20\u00d7139mm ammunition, with one gun covering the port bow and the other covering the starboard stern. The Dixmude was the first of the vessels outfitted with the cannons in March 2016.\n\nHospital\nEach ship carries a NATO Role 3 medical facility, i.e., equivalent to the field hospital of an Army division or army corps, or to the hospital of a 25,000-inhabitant city, complete with dentistry, diagnostics, specialist surgical and medical capabilities, food hygiene, and psychological capabilities. A Syracuse-based telemedicine system allows complex specialized surgery to be performed.\n\nThe 900 m2 hospital provides 20 rooms and 69 hospitalization beds, of which 7 are fit for intensive care. The two surgery blocks come complete with a radiology room providing digital radiography and ultrasonography, and that can be fitted with a mobile CT scanner.\n\n50 medicalized beds are kept in reserve and can be installed in a helicopter hangar to extend the capacity of the hospital in case of emergency", "dateOfIntroduction": 2006, "countryOfOrigin": "France", "proliferation": "France", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["France"], "dis": {"name": "L 9013 MISTRAL", "string": "01.03.071.054.001.001.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designations", "value": "Mistral;

The water jets are partially ducted, which, along with underwater control surfaces similar to a submarine's diving planes, gives the CB90 its maneuverability.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1991, "countryOfOrigin": "Sweden", "proliferation": "Estonia, Greece, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, United States of America", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Estonia", "Greece", "Mexico", "Norway", "Sweden", "United States of America"], "dis": {"name": "Unknown", "string": "00.00.000.000.000.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "CB-90; Combat Boat 90"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Fast Assault Craft"}, {"name": "Builders", "value": "Dockstavarvet, Gotlandsvarvet"}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "+300 Total Built\nGreece\nHellenic Coast Guard: 3\n Malaysia\nMalaysian Navy: 5 unit CB90, 12 unit CB90HEX\n Mexico\nMexican Navy: 48\n Norway\nRoyal Norwegian Navy: 20\n Sweden\nRoyal Swedish Navy: 147 in service, 18 on order\n United Kingdom\nRoyal Navy: 4, formerly leased from the Royal Swedish Navy, used to evaluate the option of potential acquisition and returned to the Swedish Navy.\n United States\nUS Navy: 6, known as 'Riverine Command Boat'"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "3 (two officers and one engineer)"}, {"name": "Passengers", "value": "Up to 21 amphibious troops with full equipment"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length, Overall", "value": "15.9 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "3.8 m"}, {"name": "Draught", "value": "0.8 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Empty", "value": "13,000 kg"}, {"name": "Displacement, Standard", "value": "15,300 kg"}, {"name": "Displacement, Fully Loaded", "value": "20,500 kg"}]}, {"name": "Automotive", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "2 \u00d7 Scania DSI14"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "V8 Diesel"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "625 bhp"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "40 knots (74 km/h)"}, {"name": "Range", "value": "240 nmi (440 km) at 20 knots (37 km/h)"}]}, {"name": "Armament", "sections": [{"name": "Weapon Station #1", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "3 x M2HB Heavy Machine Gun"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Heavy Machine Gun"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "3 x M2HB Heavy Machine Gun"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "1,654 mm"}, {"name": "Barrel Length", "value": "1,143 mm"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "38 kg"}, {"name": "Action", "value": "Short recoil-operated"}, {"name": "Rate of Fire", "value": "450\u2013600 rounds/min"}, {"name": "Muzzle Velocity", "value": "890 m/s"}, {"name": "Effective Fire", "value": "1,800 m"}, {"name": "Maximum Firing Range", "value": "7,400 m"}, {"name": "Feed System", "value": "Belt-fed (M2 or M9 links)"}]}, {"name": "Ammunition, Weapon Station #1", "properties": [{"name": "Type", "value": "Rifle"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "12.7", "units": "mm"}, {"name": "Cartridge", "value": "2.7\u00d799mm NATO"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "2,000 rounds"}]}, {"name": "Weapon Station #2", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "Mk 19 Grenade Launcher"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Grenade Launcher"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "1 x Mk 19 Grenade Launcher"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "1968-Present"}, {"name": "Manufacturer", "value": "Saco Defense Industries (now a division of General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems), Combined Service Forces, MKEK"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "1,090 mm"}, {"name": "Barrel Length", "value": "413 mm"}, {"name": "Width", "value": "240.4 mm"}, {"name": "Height", "value": "199 mm"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "35.2 kg (empty without accessories)"}, {"name": "Action", "value": "Blowback (Advanced primer ignition)"}, {"name": "Rate of Fire", "value": "360\u2013390 rpm (cyclic); 40 rpm (sustained); 60 rpm (rapid)"}, {"name": "Muzzle Velocity", "value": "230\u2013240 m/s"}, {"name": "Effective Firing Range", "value": "1,500 m"}, {"name": "Maximum Firing Range", "value": "2,212 m"}, {"name": "Feed System", "value": "32- or 48-grenade belt"}]}, {"name": "Ammunition, Weapon Station #2", "properties": [{"name": "Type", "value": "Grenade"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "40 mm"}, {"name": "Cartridge", "value": "40\u00d753 mm"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "INA"}]}], "properties": [{"name": "Note", "value": "The CB-90 can also carry up to 2.8 tons of mines or a Hellfire-based RBS-17 surface-to-surface missile system."}]}, {"name": "Protection", "properties": [{"name": "Hull Armor", "value": "The machinery compartment is protected by an insulated watertight bulkhead.

Designed by the Almaz Central Marine Design Bureau, subsequent vessels were built to an improved design (Project 20381), incorporating the Poliment-Redut SAM system. The ship's full displacement and dimensions are large for a corvette, thus it is designated as a frigate by NATO. The Steregushchiy class has been further developed into the Gremyashchiy class (Project 20385) and Project 20386 subclasses. The export variant is known as Project 20382 Tigr.\n\nThe ships of the Steregushchiy class are multipurpose corvettes, designed to replace the Grisha class. Such ships are used for littoral zone operations, engagement of enemy submarines and surface ships, and gun support of landing operations. The first batch built at the Severnaya Verf shipyard in St. Petersburg consists of four ships. A second building line has been started at Komsomolsk. The lead ship of this second batch was named Sovershennyy.\n\nThe Russian Navy has publicly announced that they expect to buy at least 30 of these ships, for all four major fleets.\n\nAccording to Jane's Naval Forces News, the first vessel was commissioned on 14 November 2007.\n\nAn additional order of 10 corvettes was under consideration in late 2019, according to the Deputy Commander of Pacific Fleet Igor Korolev. The ships were to be laid down at Amur Shipyard and to be commissioned into the Pacific fleet.\n\nThe Steregushchiy-class corvettes have a steel hull and composite material superstructure, with a bulbous bow and nine watertight subdivisions. They have a combined bridge and command center, and space and weight provision for eight SS-N-25 missiles. Stealth technology was widely used during the construction of the ships, as well as 21 patents and 14 new computer programs. The newest physical field reduction solutions were applied too. As a result, designers considerably reduced the ship's radar signature thanks to hull architecture and fire-resistant radar-absorbent fiberglass applied in tophamper's design.\n\nThe Kashtan CIWS on the first ship was replaced in subsequent vessels by 12 Redut VLS cells containing[9] 9M96E medium-range SAMs of the S-400 system. SS-N-27 (Kalibr type missiles) will be fitted to a larger domestic version, Project 20385.\n\nThe export version known as Project 20382 Tigr carries either eight supersonic SS-N-26 (P-800 Oniks) anti-ship missiles or sixteen subsonic SS-N-25 'Switchblade' (Kh-35E Uran). It also carries two twin-tube launchers for 533mm heavy torpedoes. The A-190E 100mm gun first used in the Talwar-class frigates is controlled by a 5P-10E system that can track four targets simultaneously. Protection from air attacks is provided by the Kashtan CIWS and eight mounts for the SA-N-10 'Grouse' (9K38 Igla) SAM.\n\nIn 2007 the Indonesian Navy made an agreement in principle (pending a full contract) for four vessels of this type to replace their aging Dutch-built Fatahillah-class corvettes. The first was to be built in Spain and fitted out in St. Petersburg, leaving open the option of Indonesian involvement in building the subsequent ships. This agreement appears to have lapsed; in 2011 Indonesia signed a deal for two Milgem-class corvettes from Turkey. Rosoboronexport has briefed Singapore and the United Arab Emirates on the vessel.\n\nThe first actual contract for the export version, Project 20382 Tigr, was signed at the 5th International Maritime Defense Show in St. Petersburg in July 2011 when Algeria ordered two ships. The cost was estimated at US$120\u2013150 million per ship.

[false, true, false, false], "notes": "The Iver Huitfeldt class is a three-ship class of frigates that entered service with the Royal Danish Navy in 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe class is built on the experience gained from the Absalon-class support ships, and by reusing the basic hull design of the Absalon class the Royal Danish Navy have been able to construct the Iver Huitfeldt class considerably cheaper than comparable ships.\n\nSide view of frigate Niels Juel in front of green hills of Harstad port\nF363 Niels Juel in Harstad (Norway), June 2018\nThe frigates are compatible with the Danish Navy's StanFlex modular mission payload system used in the Absalons, and are designed with slots for six modules.

It represents a significant improvement over the 1st-generation submarines in performance and capability. At least six hulls have already been commissioned into the PLA Navy as of 2015, and the construction programme continues. The improved Type 093B (Shang-III class) SSGN is capable of carrying log-range cruise missiles for anti-ship and land-attack.\n\nThe PLA Navy initiated the development of its next-generation Type 093 nuclear attack submarine in the mid-1980s as a successor to its 1st-generation Type 091 (Han class). However, little progress was made until the mid-1990s, when Russia agreed to transfer its nuclear submarine technology to China in exchange for urgently-needed cash. The St. Petersburg-based Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering, one of Russia\u2019s primary centres for submarine design, offered consultation to the Type 093\u2019s development, including overall hull design, engine and machinery quieting, combat system, weapon system, and countermeasures outfit.\n\nThe existence of the submarine programme was first reported by the Pentagon in 2003. The U.S. Navy intelligence and Pentagon suggested that 2 hulls in the basic variant Type 093 and 4 hulls in the improved Type 093A variant had been constructed by 2017 ((Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2017, page 24.)). While the basic variant Type 093 is only comparable to the 1970s U.S. and Russian designs such as the early variant Los Angeles (688) class and the Victor-III class, the improved Type 093A/B is believed to be approaching the later variant Los Angeles class and the Akula class in quietness and overall capability, though they still cannot match the more advanced Seawolf and Virginia class.\n\nType 093 Shang-I class\nConstruction of the Type 093 reportedly began in the late 1990s at the Huludao-based CSIC Bohai Shipbuilding Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. The first-of-class Boat 407 was launched sometime in 2001 to 2002. After a sea trial that lasted for four years, the submarine was finally commissioned by the PLA Navy in 2006. The second hull Boat 408 was launched in late 2003 and commissioned around 2007. The production then stopped and replaced by the follow-up variants.\n\nThe basic variant Type 093 (Shang I class) was said to have been partially based on the Russian Victor III class in design, though the two submarines bear no resemblance in appearance. The submarine is estimated to have 6.000 to 7,000 t displacement when dived. It features a water-drop shape hull, with a pair of fin-mounted hydroplanes and four diving planes. Six (three on each side) flank-mounted sonar arrays are clearly visible on the hull of the submarine. There are six 533 mm bow torpedo tubes (4 above, 2 below), capable of carrying the various anti-submarine/surface torpedoes of wire-, acoustic- and wake-homing, as well as the YJ-82 anti-ship cruise missile (ASCM).\n\nType 093A Shang-II class\nThis is an improved variant with a redesigned sail with a tapered front (similar to that of the Seawolf class and Virginia class) and all windows removed.\n\nType 093B Shang-III class\nThe improved Type 093B nuclear-power guided missile submarine (SSGN) was launched n 2012 and commissioned in 2015.

About 2,000 tons bigger than \u201cYulin\u201d and \u201cHengshui\u201d guided missile frigates in tonnage, the \u201cLanzhou\u201d guided missile destroyer is mounted with more powerful air-defense guided missiles and radar-detection equipment than those in the frigates. Nevertheless, coordination must be formed between these two types of warships. Although frigates are relatively small, they are very agile and can accomplish different tasks respectively under the unified command of the taskforce.\n\nDuring an air defense operation in an open air, the frigates can perform pre-phase security detection and early warning, and serve as an effective sentinel against the detection of the enemy's air defense areas. Its anti-aircraft guided missiles can also form an effective protection shield. In terms of costs, frigates cost less than destroyers. Therefore, the taskforce composed by guided missile frigates and guided missile destroyers is an effective coordination and bears key importance.\n\nThe Type 052C Luyang II is generally similar to 052B, with the notable addition of four fixed phased array antennas in the foreward superstructure. Two antennae cover the forward hemisphere while the other pair covers the rear hemisphere, the arragement adopted on the US Navy's Arleigh Burkes and the Japanese Kongos. Reports indicate this radar may be a co-development program with the Kvant-Radiolokatsiya company of the Ukraine. The band and performance of this radar have not yet been publicly reported. The radar may be a developed version of that first seen on the No. 970 weapons development ship, and could either be S-Band or Russian-style X-Band.\n\nBased on the hull design of the Type 052B (Luyang class) multirole destroyer, the Type 052C features an indigenously developed e four-array multifunction phased array radar (PAR) similar to the Aegis AN/SPY-1 equipped by the U.S. Arleigh Burke class and Japanese Kongo class DDG. The ship is also armed with the indigenous HQ-9 air defence missile system, which is believed to be comparable to the Russian S-300F/Rif in performance, and a newly developed anti-ship cruise missile (ASCM) designated YJ-62 (C-602).\n\nThe Type 052C is fitted with four multifunction phased array radar antenna. The radar is reportedly developed by Nanjing Research Institute of Electronic Technology (also known as 14 Institute). There is also a Type 517H-1 (NATO codename: Knife Rest) long-range 2D air search radar; a Russian Band Stand fire-control radar (for anti-ship missile and main gun); and two Type 327G (EFR-1, NATO codename: Rice Lamp) fire control radar for the CIWS.\n\nBy adopting a modular approach where two classes of destroyers shared the same hull design and propulsions, Jiangnan was able to save construction time and costs in the programs. However, unlike the Type 052B Luyang class, which was fitted with a mixture of both Russian and Chinese indigenous systems, the Type 052C Luyang-II class was largely based on the indigenous technologies. The bridge is also much taller on the Type 052C, so that four fixed phased array radar antennas can be embedded on its four sides.\n\nUsing the same stealthy hull and engine configuration of the No. 168 class, this destroyer is armed with forty-eight new type vertical-launched anti-aircraft missiles of either Russian or Chinese origin. As such they will be the first dedicated long range air defense ships for the PLAN. The forward VLS station (possibly 6 revolver launchers, each with 6 missiles) are between the forward CIWS platform and the main gun, while the aft VLS station (possibly a pair of six-pack revolver launchers) are forward of the helicopter hanger.\n\nA total of 48 indigenous HQ-9 air defence missiles are housed in eight 6-cell vertical launch systems (VLS). Unlike the Russian-style revolver VLS, the Type 052C\u2019s VLS is fixed with each launch cell having its own lid. The missile system utilises the \u2018cold launch\u2019 method, in which the missile was first ejected from the launch tube, and then ignites its rocket engine at low altitude. This launch method avoids the complex flame and gas exhausting pipes on the Western-style \u2018hot launch\u2019 VLS, and also decreases damage to the ship structure caused by the rocket motor blast.\n\nThe naval variant HQ-9 was developed from the land-based HQ-9 surface-to-air missile system developed in the 1990s. The missile may have adopted some Russian S-300 rocket motor and control technologies, with a \u201cTrack via Missile\u201d (TVM) guidance system developed from the U.S. Patriot missile technology. The missile is housed inside a cylinder shape container, which is placed inside the VLS. The missile is guided by an unknown type of guidance radar with multi-target engagement capability.\n\nThe surface-to-surface weapon of the Type 052C destroyer is the indigenously developed YJ-62 (C-602) ASCM. A pair of quadruple semi-cylindical racks for the new YJ-62 long-range SSM are between the rear mast and the helicopter hanger. The missiles are guided by the Band Stand radar on top of the bridge and a Light Bulb datalink forward of the hanger. The same guidance package was also found onboard 052B. A metric-wave radar with Yagi antenna is midship, for long range detection or ECM. A new EW suite featuring phased array antennas similar to AN/SLQ-32 EW system is on the side of the forward mast. The ship was also expected to have a new generation of Aegis-like C3I system. The ships feature an aft flight deck for the Z-9C ASW helicopter, and a hangar that can support a pair of these helicopters.\n\nUnlike the previous YJ-8 series anti-ship missiles, which were all carried inside a box-shape launcher, the YJ-62 is carried inside a cylinder-shape launcher. A total of eight missiles (two 4-cell launchers) are located at the mid-ship position. The missiles are guided by the Band Stand radar installed on top of the bridge and a Light Bulb datalink forward of the hanger. The YJ-62 missile uses strap-down inertial guidance coupled with GPS, and active radar for the terminal phase. The missile has a stated range of 280km, with the missile flying at an altitude of 30m during the cruise phase of an engagement. In the terminal phase, the missile descends 7~10m. The active radar seeker has an acquisition range of up to 40km.\n\nThe ship has a single-barrel 100mm gun developed by 713 Institute on the basis of the French Creusot-Loire T100C design. The gun can be used against surface targets and air targets such as aircraft and low speed missile, with a maximum rate of fire of 90 rounds/min. The gun can be operated in fully automatic mode from the radar control system, from the shipborne optical sighting system, or laid manually. The turret design incorporates strong radar cross-section reduction features.\n\nFor short-range air defence, the Type 052C is equipped with two (one front, one rear) Type 730 close-in weapon system (CIWS) for short-range air defence. The two Type 730 CIWS have been relocated to the raised platform in front of bridge and atop the rear helicopter hanger. The two seven-barrel 30mm Type 730 CIWS are located both sides behind the bridge. The weapon system has a maximum rate of fire of 4,600~5,800 rounds/min and a maximum range of 3km.\n\nA destroyer\u2019s overall air defence, surface strike, and antisubmarine warfare (ASW) capabilities largely depend on how well different weapon systems and sensors are integrated together by the combat system. Most Chinese warships use the command and control system derived from the French Thomson-CSF TAVITAC, but the Type 052C might have a newly developed system with improved processing power to engage anti-ship missile threats.\n\nAlthough the detailed information on the combat system of the Type 052C is unknown, it is likely that the system comprises the multifunction phased array radar system, command and decision system, battlefield display system, and weapon control system. The command and decision system receives data from ship sensors and provides command, control and threat assessment. The weapon control system receives engagement instruction from the command and decision system, selects weapons and interfaces with the weapon fire control systems.\n\nIn together with its long-range air defence missile and close-in weapon system (CIWS), the Type 052C is the first Chinese-made surface combatant with a true fleet air defence capability. The combat system will ensure that the ship can engage multiple air targets such as sea-skimming missile and aircraft simultaneously. The ship might also be able to transmit combat information to other ships and aircraft via datalink and satellite communications to form a maritime combat network.\n\nThe destroyer\u2019s stern hanger accommodates one Kamov Ka-28 (NATO codename: Helix) antisubmarine warfare (ASW) helicopter. Carrying various weapons including torpedoes and deep charges, the helicopter can operate in all weather conditions up to 200km from the host ship. Alternatively, the destroyer can carry an indigenous Z-9C helicopter.\n\nThe Type 052C\u2019s propulsion is in the form of CODOG, consisting of two Ukraine-made DA80/DN80 gas turbines rated at 48,600hp and two Shaanxi diesels (Chinese copy of the MTU 20V956TB92) rated at 8,840hp (6.5 MW).\n\nTwo Type 052C (NATO codename: Luyang-II class) air defence guided missile destroyers have been built by Jiangnan Shipyard of Shanghai for the PLA Navy. Following the launch of two Type 052B multirole missile destroyers in 2002, Shanghai-based Jiangnan Shipyard began to build two subsequent hulls based on the same hull design but with different weapon and sensor configuration. The first-of-class 170 Lanzhou was laid down in late 2002 and launched on 29 April 2003. Sea trial began in late 2003 and the destroyer was commissioned in July 2004. The second hull, 171 Haikou was launched on 30 October 2003 and was commissioned in 2005. Both hulls are deployed by the South Sea Fleet based at Zhanjiang in Guangdong Province.\n\nThe fourth unit of the Luhai class (probably Type 052C or possibly Type 052BK?) was also constructed at Jiangnan Shipyard, as the two Type 052B DDGs were being fitted out. The Type 052 series has evidently embraced a modular design featuring spiral development, with new variants being introduced after only one or two units of the previous version.\n\nAs of early 2004 a pair of 052Cs were under construction (170 & 171) with the first ship launched on 29 April 2003 and the second on 30 October 2003. The building of two 052Bs and two 052Cs in such a short time frame reflects the PLAN's need to replace the obsolete air-defense systems of its surface ships. In June 2005 it was reported that two Luyang II missile destroyers were undergoing sea trials. The fourth Type 052C class destroyer, pennant number 173 went into service with the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLA Navy) in June 2012.\n\nAfter commissioning no new destroyers in 2008-2010, construction of new destroyers appeared to have resumed with serial production of Luyang II-class ships. Construction of the LUYANG II-class DDG (Type 052C) continued, with one ship entering service in 2012, and an additional three ships under various stages of construction and sea trials, bringing the total number of ships of this class to six by the end of 2013.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2004, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "DDG LUYANG II TYPE 052C CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.004.007.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 052C Class; Luyang II Class"}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "6 Built"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Destroyer"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Jiangnan Shipyard"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "2004-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "280"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "154.0 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "17.0 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "6.0 m"}, {"name": "Draught", "value": "6.0 M"}, {"name": "Displacement, Full Load", "value": "6,500 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "2 x Ukraine DA80/DN80 gas turbines and 2 x Shaanxi diesels"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "Ukraine DA80/DN80 gas turbines: 48,600 shp total.\nShaanxi diesels: 8,840 total bhp"}, {"name": "Shafts", "value": "2"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "29 knots"}, {"name": "Range", "value": "6,000 nm at 14 kts; 1,600 nm at 30 kts"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "INA"}]}, {"name": "Missile Systems", "sections": [{"name": "Missile System #1", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "HQ-9 VLS"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "48 cell HQ-9 VLS SAM system"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "1 x 48 cell HQ-9 VLS SAM system"}, {"name": "Launcher Type", "value": "Vertical Launch System (VLS)"}, {"name": "Missile Name", "value": "HQ-9"}, {"name": "Missile Type", "value": "medium- to long-range, active radar homing surface-to-air missile."}, {"name": "Missile Basic Load", "value": "48"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "6.8 m"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "1300 kg"}, {"name": "Warhead Type", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Warhead Weight", "value": "180 kg"}, {"name": "Engine", "value": "Two-stage solid propellant rocket"}, {"name": "Operational Range", "value": "200 km (FD-2000 version) 250 km (HQ-9A version) 300+ km for HQ-9B version"}, {"name": "Flight Ceiling", "value": "27 km"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "Mach 4.2"}, {"name": "Guidance System", "value": "Inertial guidance with mid-course update and terminal active radar homing"}, {"name": "Launch Platform", "value": "*Taian TA580/TAS5380 8\u00d78 transporter erector launcher (TEL) \n*Type 052C destroyer\n*Type 052D destroyer\n*Type 055 destroyer"}]}, {"name": "Missile System #2", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "Quad YJ-62 (C-602) SSM launchers"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "2 x Quad YJ-62 (C-602) SSM launchers"}, {"name": "Launcher Type", "value": "SSM Launcher"}, {"name": "Manufacturer", "value": "China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation"}, {"name": "Proliferation", "value": "Widely Proliferated"}, {"name": "Missile Name", "value": "YJ-62"}, {"name": "Missile Type", "value": "Subsonic Anti-Ship Cruise Missile"}, {"name": "Missile Basic Load", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Diameter", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Warhead Weight", "value": "210 kg"}, {"name": "Detonation Mechanism", "value": "Semi-armor-piercing"}, {"name": "Operational Range", "value": "400 km"}, {"name": "Flight Altitude", "value": "7 \u2013 10 meter terminal"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "Mach 0.6-0.8"}, {"name": "Guidance System", "value": "Inertial/active terminal guidance"}, {"name": "Launch Platform", "value": "TEL\nType 052C destroyer"}]}]}, {"name": "Gun Systems", "sections": [{"name": "Gun System #1", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "Type 210"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Naval Gun"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "100mm"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "2 x Type 210 100mm Naval Gun Systems"}, {"name": "Rate of Fire", "value": "The weapon's maximum rate of fire for a single type of unguided round was 90 rounds per minute."}, {"name": "Range", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "The Type 210 automatic single 100 mm naval gun is the Chinese modification of the Compact model of the French 100 mm naval gun.

It is the country's second aircraft carrier after the completion of Liaoning, and the first built domestically. Shandong was initially designated as a Type 001A air carrier during development but was finalized as Type 002 at commissioning.\n\nShandong was constructed by the Dalian Shipbuilding Industry, part of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, in Dalian, Liaoning province, China. According to the state media service Xinhua, they started fabrication of vessel in November 2013 and laid down the keel for its hull in a drydock beginning in March 2015. The Chinese government did not publicly confirm the ship's existence until construction was well underway. Satellite imagery for the defense analysis industry showed the aircraft carrier in the early stages of hull assembly by March 2015. Public photos of a hull with military characteristics at the Dalian shipyard surfaced on the internet the next month. In October 2015, the first definitive signs of the vessel's role appeared when construction of a hangar deck began on the hull. In December 2015, a Chinese defense ministry spokesman confirmed that the ship was an aircraft carrier, stating that the design and construction work was underway.\n\nIn May 2016, the ski jump takeoff ramp was noted to be close to the installation. The ship's island superstructure was fabricated in two parts: the nine-deck forward half, containing the bridge and mainmast, was installed by September of that year; the aft half, with the funnel and air intakes, was installed in the weeks that followed. By the end of 2016, the ship was substantially structurally complete.\n\nFollowing the launch, the carrier was fitted out and underwent early tests of the propulsion system. The dockside system trials began after the out-fitting was completed in November 2017.\n\nAt the time of its launch, the ship was not expected to be delivered to PLAN until 2020; however, successful early tests put the project ahead of schedule, and media reports indicated that it could enter the navy fleet in 2019. While its predecessor Liaoning has been used largely as a training ship since it entered active service in 2012, Type 002 is expected to be used in regular military operational service.\n\nThe aircraft carrier's design is largely based on China's first carrier Liaoning, which was itself built from the partially complete hull of the Soviet Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier Varyag. It retains the ski-jump takeoff, which limits its air wing to helicopters and Shenyang J-15 fighter jets, and the ship is powered by conventional oil-fired boilers driving eight steam turbines derived from the Soviet-designed examples installed on Liaoning. It measures about 315 meters (1,033 ft) long, with a displacement of about 55,000 tonnes (70,000 loaded).\n\nHowever, it carries modifications and upgrades compared to Liaoning. It has increased storage for ammunition and fuel, with a larger aircraft capacity of 44 aircraft, eight more than Liaoning. Shandong has a broader flight deck but a shorter island superstructure than Liaoning to give more space for aircraft movements. The island also has redesigned radars and a new bridge, while the fleet command and flight control tower are on separate floors for more efficiency. It includes an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar system.\n\nShandong, like its predecessor, uses the simpler \"short take-off but arrested recovery\" (STOBAR) launch and recovery system. Future carriers, such as the Type 003 aircraft carrier, are planned to use an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) that allows the launch of heavier and more advanced aircraft such as the Shenyang J-31 or the Chengdu J-20.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2019, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "CV SHANDONG TYPE 001A CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.001.016.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Shandong Class; Type 002 Class; Type 001A Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Aircraft Carrier"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Dalian Shipbuilding Industry"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "2019-Present"}, {"name": "Pendent", "value": "CV-17"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "2,000", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Aircrew", "value": "500", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Flag Staff", "value": "126", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "90 days"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "315", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Beam, Waterline", "value": "38", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Beam, Deck", "value": "72", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Draught", "value": "11", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Flight Deck Length", "value": "304.5", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Flight Deck Width", "value": "72", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Hanger Deck Length", "value": "153", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Standard", "value": "48 000 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Full Load", "value": "64 000 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Steam Boilers", "value": "8", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Steam Turbines", "value": "4", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "200,000 shp"}, {"name": "Shafts", "value": "4", "units": "ea"}]}, {"name": "Main Gun System", "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "3 x Type 730 CIWS"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Close-In Weapon System (CIWS)"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "30 mm"}, {"name": "Main Armament", "value": "The 30 mm Gatling gun mount designated as H/PJ-12 is extremely similar to the General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger.

H/PJ-12 is versatile in that its FCS can be either separately installed at different locations like the Soviet AK-630, or directly integrated on the gun mount.

The Type 901 replenishment vessel \u2013 which helps supply naval ships with oil, ammunition, food and water \u2013 was seen at a port in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province on 31 July 2017 bearing the number 965, indicating it has been commissioned into the PLA Navy. The new supply ship has almost double the displacement tonnage of the Type 903 supply ships currently being used for escort and anti-piracy missions off Somalia.\n\nChina\u2019s ambitious program to build more capable ocean-going fleet replenishment vessels is too often overlooked. In recent years, new units of the Type-903 (plus the improved 903A variant) replenishment vessels have entered service. An even more capable successor, touted the Type-901, which is said to displace some 40-45,000 tons (just slightly smaller than the new carrier itself), was at an advanced stage of construction.\n\nThe class designator for the ship appeared to be Type 901. Details were initially limited, but the ship's estimated dimensions are a displacement of 40,000-45,000 tones and a beam of 31.5 m. Although photographs - shown on the cjdby.net website, for example - had only just emerged, the ship was at an advanced state of construction and a launch in early 2016 seemed probable.\n\nThe photos showed the largely completed hull of the ship docked side-by-side with a similar-sized Type 903A, also known as the \"Qiandaohu-class\" replenishment ship, with a light displacement of 23,000 tones. The new ship appears to be a modified 903A with many different design features.\n\nChina since 2008 began to develop large-scale comprehensive supply ship and rapid combat support ship. The new 40,000-ton comprehensive supply ship has been started in 2013 construction, and 50,000-ton fast combat support ship also started construction in 2014 to 2015. It is reported that China's new generation of large-scale comprehensive supply ship and fast combat support ship with a new power system, equipped with China's own development of a new generation of integrated supply system, will provide a comprehensive combat capability comparable with the US military.\n\nA new breakthrough of Chinese naval shipbuilding - the lead ship (name yet unknown putative number \"956\"??) was launched on 15 December 2015 and left the factory for sea trials on 19 December 2016. The PLA Navy large complex supply ship was built in Guangzhou shipyard of China Shipbuilding State Corporation (CSSC).\n\nThe two-level ship can be used as a one-stop logistics center for aircraft carrier formation, capable of receiving, storing, delivering fuel, ammunition, dry goods and other supplies, with the ability to receive directly from the base and re-supply from the ship. It is said that the large-scale comprehensive supply ship will play the role of large-scale oil tanker and comprehensive supply vessel in our Navy. The rapid combat support ship is mainly for our aircraft carrier battle group service. In the next few years, with the new generation of large-scale comprehensive supply ship And fast combat support ships have been serving, China's offshore combat capability will see an unprecedented increase.\n\nThe Chinese Navy has accepted the first in a class of fast, giant resupply ships that will refuel, resupply, and rearm its aircraft carriers and destroyers on the high seas. The Type 901 class was built at the Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) Longxue. Thirty-one-and-a-half meters wide and over 200 meters long, the first Type 901 class supply ship woulf have a full displacement of around 40,000-45,000 tons. That's a similar size to the US Navy's 49,000-ton Supply class replenishment ships, which can carry over 17,000 tons of jet and ship fuel, and 1950 tons of ammunition.\n\nThe Type 901 is thought to have 4 gas turbine engines, which would give it a top speed of around 25 knots, enabling it to keep pace with Chinese aircraft carriers like the Liaoning. It will have up to five resupply gantries located midship, each of which can deploy palletized ammunition and supplies via cables, or fuel lines. This will allow the Type 901 to replenish multiple warships simultaneously while under sail, a key capability for modern navies. It will also be able to operate helicopters and drones from its helipad and hangar. While not a combat ship, it is expected, like US Navy ships, to carry some weapons for self-defense, most likely 30mm auto-cannons used in an air defense, anti-missile role.\n\nThe Type 901 will offer a great leap in capacity over the current 25,000-ton Type 903A Qiandaohu, of which the PLAN has eight. The Type 901's larger supply carrying capacity means that it can refuel and rearm Chinese warships, including destroyers and carriers, in combat operations far from the Chinese mainland. Also, its larger size gives the Type 901 a greater range than its predecessor, thus reducing the need for foreign facilities to refuel and replenish, both for the Type 901 and the warships it supports. While China's interest in building long-range carriers, destroyers and submarines and leasing foreign bases (like Djibouti) are getting a lot of attention, Beijing is also clearly at work solving the logistics challenges needed to make the PLAN a true global power.\n\nThe new Type 901 replenishment ship began sea trials on 18 December 2016, according to Chinese media. The 45,000-tonne vessel, which was built at Guangzhou Shipyard International's Longxue shipyard on the Pearl River, was expected to provide logistics support to the PLAN's carrier force. Imagery of the ship's construction emerged in late 2015, before it was launched on 15 December 2015.\n\nThe vessel is equipped with three gantries and a fourth high-point structure port side aft, configured with five hose rigs for liquid refueling on the port side and four on the starboard side. The central gantry provides a transfer station for solids on each side.\n\nFrom official photos released 24 March 2017 it can be seen that the second 901-type supply ship, which was reported in January 2017, had been hoisting. This led to speculation that it will be launched within six months. The 901-type high-speed supply ship is specialized in the aircraft carrier formation of the new supply ship, currently only the two countries have built similar ships.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2017, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "AOE FUYU TYPE 901 CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.016.050.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 901 Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Fast Combat Support Ship"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Guangzhou Shipyard"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "2017-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Note #1", "value": "The Type 901 appears to be designed with similar missions to the Supply-class fast combat support ship[8] which is to keep large surface action groups supplied."}, {"name": "Note #2", "value": "The two-level ship can be used as a one-stop logistics center for aircraft carrier formation, capable of receiving, storing, delivering fuel, ammunition, dry goods and other supplies, with the ability to receive directly from the base and re-supply from the ship.

It was originally built for the Russian Navy and underwent sea trials.Subsequently, the contract was cancelled by France and agreement on compensation reached with the Russian government. Egypt and France concluded the deal to acquire the two former Russian Mistral for roughly 950 million euros. Egypt is the first and to date only country in Africa and the Middle East to possess a helicopter carrier.\n\nThe Russian government placed an order for the ship in 2011. The construction of the ship would be shared between the countries with France building about 60 percent and Russia 40. Work started in France, in Saint-Nazaire, on 1 February 2012 and in the Russian Baltiysky Zavod shipyard in St. Petersburg in October 2012. Russia would send its parts to France for final assembly. The ship was expected to join the Russian Navy in 2015. The ship was launched on 15 October 2013. The ship began its first sea trials on 5 March 2014.\n\nSavings in construction costs were anticipated, due to the use of commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts, rather than requiring every system to be designed to military standards.\n\nThe Russian acquisition of French Mistral-class amphibious assault ships was considered to be the largest defense deal between Russia and the West since World War II.\n\nThe 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine triggered rising international criticism. France was under political pressure from other nations to sanction Russia by cancelling or suspending delivery of the two Mistral-class vessels.\n\nOn 3 September 2014, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande released an announcement that France was suspending the delivery of Vladivostok to Russia due to the ongoing War in Donbass, Ukraine.\n\nBy 13 September 2014, a partial ceasefire was in place in Ukraine. This improvement in conditions in Ukraine was sufficient for French authorities to allow Vladivostok to go to sea for her acceptance trials. French Defence Ministry sources said a decision on the delivery of Vladivostok would be taken by mid-November. On 25 November, it was announced that delivery of the two ships was to be postponed indefinitely. Russia threatened legal action over the postponement. In August 2015 the two governments reached agreement on terms for cancelling the contract; France would keep the ships and fully reimburse Russia.\n\nOn 7 August 2015, a French diplomatic source confirmed that President Hollande discussed the matter with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi during his visit to Egypt during the inauguration of the New Suez Canal in Ismailia. Subsequently, Egypt and France concluded the deal to acquire the two former Russian Mistral for roughly 950 million euros, including the costs of training Egyptian crews. Speaking on RMC Radio, Jean-Yves Le Drian, French Defence Minister, said that Egypt had already paid the whole price for the helicopter carriers. \n\nOn 2 June 2016, DCNS delivered the first of two helicopter carriers acquired by the Arab Republic of Egypt in October 2015, the Landing Helicopter Dock Gamal Abdel Nasser. The flag transfer ceremony took place in the presence of Egyptian and French Navies\u2019 Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Rabie and Admiral Rogel, Herv\u00e9 Guillou, chairman and chief executive officer of DCNS, Laurent Castaing, chairman and chief executive officer of STX France, and senior Egyptian and French officials. Before sailing to Alexandria, the helicopter carrier Gamal Abdel Nasser participated in a joint exercise between the Egyptian and French Navies.  On 16 September 2016, DCNS delivered the second of two helicopter carriers, the Landing Helicopter Dock Anwar El Sadat which also participated in a joint exercise with the French Navy before arriving at its home port of Alexandria.\n\nAircraft \nSince receiving its two Mistral-class carriers, Egypt had issued an international tender for the procurement of new maritime helicopters. The Egyptian Navy and Air Force studied several offers for helicopters to use on both carriers. European and Russian manufacturers entered the bidding procedure; NHIndustries and Airbus Helicopters were reported to have offered their NH90 and Tiger helicopters, while Russian Helicopters offered its Ka-52K helicopter. By May 2017, the tender had reached its final stage, Russian Helicopters stated that it would intermediary enter into pricing negotiations if the company won the tender.

According to NukeMap simulations, the size of the radioactive area will be about 1700\u00d7300 kilometers. For this purpose, the Poseidon is believed to be equipped with a toxic cobalt bomb, containing cobalt-60. Poseidon appears to be a deterrent weapon of last resort.\n\nAn aircraft carrier battle group would have reduced chances of defending itself against it. The drone could detonate its very large warhead at standoff range, and anti-submarine warfare units would have very little time to react because of the speed at which it travels.\n\nThe Poseidon appears to be a torpedo-shaped robotic mini-submarine that can travel at speeds of 185 km/h (100 knots). More recent information suggests a top speed of 100 km/h (54 knots), with a range of 10,000 km (5,400 nmi; 6,200 mi) and a depth maximum of 1,000 m (3,300 ft).\n\nThe typical depth of the drone may be about 50\u2013100 meters for increased stealth features in low-speed stealth mode. Low depth in stealth mode is preferred because sound waves move to the ocean floor and reduce the radius of detection. Submarines use the same strategy in silent running mode.\n\nIt is 1.6\u20132 meters in diameter, and 24 meters long. The warhead shown in the leaked figure is a cylinder 1.5 meters in diameter by 4 meters in length, giving a volume of 7 cubic meters. Comparing this to the volumes of other large thermonuclear bombs, the 1961 Soviet-era Tsar Bomba itself measured 8 meters long by 2.1 meters in diameter, indicates that the yield is at least several tens of megatons, generally consistent with early reports of 100 megatons. Some reports suggest the yield of the Poseidon's warhead is as low as 2 Mt.\n\nThe National Interest compiled several unclassified defense sources from General Electric experts about the similar 601B project and they predicted low weight and the compact gas-cooled nuclear reactor in the drone. Russian submarine designers say that a low-power reactor is preferred for Poseidon because a smaller reactor is less noisy.\n\nThe development includes also the use of stealth technology, to elude acoustic tracking devices.[25][30][38] Poseidon uses a silent running strategy like other submarines. Its main stealth feature is its very low speed before it reaches the target area. Its high-speed mode activates upon reaching a short finish range (2-3 kilometers) when the probability of detection of the drone is considerably higher. It could travel for weeks toward enemy port cities, reaching high-speed only in the final stage.\n\nRussian designers estimated the radius of detection of the drone will be about 2\u20133 km (1.2\u20131.9 mi) for 55 km/h (34 mph). A second important stealth feature of the drone is the special design of the pump-jet for clearance of the drone's acoustic signature to imitate the noise of civil ships.\n\nThe Poseidon is a family of drones rather than a single type, with some Poseidon's designed only for destroying coastal cities and thus relying on \"stealth\" capabilities rather than on high speed, and other ones primarily designed to attack carrier battle groups, where the later ones may use the supercavitation, like the VA-111 Shkval torpedo, to be able to gain extremely high speed in attack mode (more than 200 km/h (120 mph)). However, supercavitation devices have not been observed on the available footage of Poseidon. Pentagon estimates the maximum speed of the Poseidon about 56 knots (104 km/h; 64 mph) without the supercavitation option.\n\n\nVessels that are speculated to carry the Poseidon, the Project 09852 Oscar-class submarine Belgorod and the Project 09851 Khabarovsk submarines, are new boats deployed in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Oscar-class submarines could carry four Poseidon torpedoes at the same time for a total yield of up to 400 megatonnes.\n\nAccording to some reports, the Poseidon may also have a seabed or mobile site launch option. In the seabed option, known as Skif (\u0421\u043a\u0438\u0444), Poseidon can wait on the seafloor in a special container for as long as necessary. It is known that the Russian auxiliary vessel ZVEZDOCHKA 600 (Project 20180) with ice-breaking capability is being used for testing of the Poseidon drones, thus it's believed the ship can be also used as the platform for deploying and retrieving a seabed version of the drone.

There are currently two units in active service with the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force. It was succeeded by the Type 051B.\n\nDesigned by the China Warship Design Institute (formerly the Seventh Academy of the Ministry of National Defense), both ships were built at Jiangnan Shipyard - No. 112 Harbin was the first Luhu destroyer followed by No. 113 Qingdao. The chief designer was academician Mr. Pan Jingfu (\u6f58\u955c\u8299). The class is said to be the first indigenous Chinese warship design approaching modern standards, a significant improvement over the earlier Luda class. The Luhu class made extensive use of foreign technologies that were accessible to the PRC prior to the Tiananmen Square incident of 1989. These included French-made radars and fire-control systems and the General Electric LM2500 gas turbine engines from the US, two of which power each ship. The Type 052 became the first Chinese destroyer design to use gas turbine engines, and also the first equipped with an integrated combat system.\n\nEven with incorporation of Western technology, the chronic lack of adequate shipborne air defense systems has had great impact on PLAN operations. Equipped with a small number of surface-to-air missiles with visual-range only and guns with limited range and performance, Chinese warships have historically limited their operations to the area covered by their land-based aircraft due to a lack of fleet defense capability. To rectify this trend, the Luhu destroyers (and the smaller Jiangwei class frigate) were fitted with the HQ-7 SAM that gives them much better air defense capability than other previous Chinese designs, although they are still limited to within visual range (WVR).\n\nThe HQ-7 SAM system is reported to be equipped with 8 ready to fire missiles, plus 16 stored in a semi-automatic reloader system. The same system is also used on the upgraded 051G Luda Destroyer.\n\nIn spite of the advances, the 052 Luhu-class destroyers still suffer in some areas such as electronic warfare and electronic counter-measures.\n\nThe operational capability of the Luhu-class destroyers has been called into question by naval analysts. Ship visits in 1997 allowed US Naval officers to board and inspect Luhu Destroyer No. 112 Harbin and to take numerous photographs. Analysis of these photographs and reports by officers present strongly suggested that the Luhu destroyers were mainly intended as technology demonstration vessels rather than serious naval combatants. For example, the large amount of foreign-supplied equipment onboard was still labeled in the language of the country of origin; this was also the case with most of the onboard manuals and other documentation, calling into question the ability of the crew to operate efficiently under stressful circumstances when called upon to deal with equipment labeled in English, French, or Italian, as well as Chinese. Furthermore, the various European systems installed were not originally designed to operate together and as a result were not well integrated - a problem the Chinese could not overcome owing to their lack of familiarity with the underlying technology. The Chinese attempted to address these problems with the introduction of an improved Luhu design, the Luhai-class. This follow-on, essentially an enlarged Luhu, features some improved electronics from foreign suppliers as well as more advanced weapons. However, in some cases, the designers appear to have opted for less capable indigenous designs to ease the system integration issues suffered by the Luhu-class destroyers. The PLAN was reportedly unhappy with the design of the Luhai-class destroyers and production ceased after a single unit was completed.\n\nAccording to Chinese media and internet sources, the Luhu-class is mainly used as a technological demonstrator to compare and evaluate different foreign systems, and the two ships initially did not have identical equipment. The first unit had a licensed production of Raytheon AN/SQS-56 sonar, the Italian DE-1164 integrated sonar system, which consists of DE-1160 hull mounted sonar (HMS) and DE-1163 variable depth sonar (VDS), and these were later replaced by domestic copy, SJD-7 sonar system. The second unit had French Thomson-CSF DUBV 23/43 HMS/VDS, which were subsequently replaced by domestic copy SJD-9 sonar system. the combat data systems for the first unit was ZKJ-3 (ZKJ-III), a Chinese equivalent of the Italian IPN-10 combat data system. ZKJ-3 is developed from the export version of IPN-10, SADOC 2, (SADOC = systema dirizione della Operazioni di combattimento). SADOC 2 was sold to China in 1985 and it differs from IPN-10 in that it lacks the data link the latter has. Incorporation of a domestic data link is the main improvement of Chinese ZKJ-3, making it the Chinese equivalent of IPN-10. The combat data system of the second unit is ZKJ-4, which is the Chinese version of French Thomson-CSF TAVITAC combat data system, two of which were sold to China in 1985 and delivered 2\u20133 years later. These combat data systems were later replaced by more advanced follow-on equipment such as ZKJ-4A/B series during upgrades. Experience gained in handling these foreign systems has helped subsequent development of similar Chinese systems.\n\n2011 Upgrade:\nBoth of the Type 052 destroyers were upgraded in 2011. The four Type 76A guns were replaced by two Type 730 CIWS on top of the helicopter hangar. The Crotale/HHQ-7 short-range SAM may have been replaced by the newer model (FM-90?) which provides better interception against sea-skimming AShMs. Two Type 726-4 decoy launchers were installed on the sides of the forward bridge for better self-protection. Various onboard systems were integrated together (to a certain degree) by a Thomson-CSF TAVITAC combat data system which is thought to have been replaced by a new indigenous C3I system (ZJK-4B or a newer model). The Thomson-CSF Sea Tiger air/surface search radar was first replaced by an indigenous Type 518 Hai Ying radar and is now replaced by a Type 517M long-range air search radar.

The Type 056A includes a SJG-206 Variable-Depth, Low-Frequency, Towed Array Sonar System. \n\nJiangdao Type-056 Frigate/Corvette (FFL)\nReputed as the new-generation \u201cmaritime cavalry\u201d, the 056 frigate is rapidly augmenting the PLA Navy\u2019s littoral warfare capabilities, especially in the South China Sea and East China Sea. This new class of small combatant augment the 60 HOUBEI-class wave-piercing catamaran missile patrol boats (PTG) (Type 022).\n\nThe frigate was deployed primarily for patrol and escort missions as well as anti-submarine operations and sea combat tasks, independent or in coordination with other forces. Its primary duty is to patrol sea areas. The South China Sea has relatively high requirements for single patrol boats because it is far from the coast and is often choppy.\n\nPatrolling is a daily labor-intensive task, and requires a large number of soldiers. Therefore, patrol boats should be deployed in a large scale and cost less than warships. Unlike fighting, patrolling does not need too many weapons. Overall, ships designed for patrolling should have good seakeeping ability and be relatively cheap.\n\nThe Type-056 frigate aimed at changing the situation of China's active-service base-defense system featuring aging military strength, single function and low combat power. The new-generation base-defense military strength commissioned in large quantities was another important platform for optimizing the equipment structure of the PLA Navy, improving the base-defense combat power as well as enhancing the PLA Navy's capability of safeguarding China's national security and territorial integrity, and defending China's maritime sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.\n\nThe construction of the 056 frigate has come to an end in late 2019 and the upgrading of the domestic offshore combat system has been completed. Type 056 frigate is a type 1 light frigate developed by the Chinese Navy in the new century. According to overseas sources, it has a length of 89 meters, a width of 12 meters, a full-load displacement of 1,300 tons, diesel power, dual-axis propulsion, a maximum speed of 28 knots, and a cruising range of 3,500 nautical miles. The type 056 frigate weapon and the onboard electronic system are relatively simple. The weapon includes two double-mounted YJ-83 anti-ship missile launchers, one 8-unit red flag 10 ship-to-air missile launcher, and the main gun is a 76 mm gun. , 2 30mm single-tube remote-control naval guns, and anti-submarine weapons are two 2-unit antisubmarine torpedo launchers. Shipborne electronic systems include air / sea search radars, optoelectronic fire control systems, electronic warfare systems, and shipborne combat systems. The bow has a helicopter take-off and landing deck, which can take off and land straight -9 anti-submarine helicopters, but there is no hangar, which limits its helicopter operation capabilities.\n\nThe Type 056 frigate weapon is relatively simple and mainly performs offshore patrol tasks. The PLA Navy had to build large warships if it is to go to the high sea, but large warship will be a waste of resources if it\u2019s only used for \u201cyard-protecing\u201d. The PLA Navy needed vessels that are suitable for carrying out fishing protection, patrol and guarding tasks at the \u201chouse gate\u201d, so that it can free the large combat ships from the trivial everyday maritime services and consequently ensure the combat capacity of main high-sea-going taskforces. With complete functions, the 056 guided missile frigate is capable of air defense, anti-submarine warfare, assault, and garrisoning. Such high cost effectiveness better caters to the rapidly increasing equipment manufacturing of the PLA Navy.\n\nThe PLA Navy\u2019s inshore combat tasks mainly consist of daily patrol, guarding, fishing protection, and other low-intensity and low-risk tasks. It provides the basic maritime force support for the civilian and law enforcement forces of oceanic administration and fishing affair bureau in coping with the provocations by military vessels of enemy states. Light surface vessels have to be used in the early stage of islands disputes. The flexible body and comprehensive combat capability of the 056 guided missile frigate decide that it is of best use on islands and the surrounding waters, where it can deal with all kinds of maritime crisis flexibly and make the mobilization and deployment of large vessels more effective.\n\nDesigned not solely for islands disputes but for more extensive purposes such as maritime target assaulting, air defense and anti-submarine, the 056 guide missile frigate is a light maritime striking weapon platform with the highest performance-price ratio and the widest applications. It can be manufactured by a number of coastal and inland shipyards on a large scale and in large quantities and supplied to the PLA Navy incessantly. Light guide missile frigate can serve as steady support for PLA Navy\u2019s high-sea-going maneuver combat and help free the inshore fast attack forces from everyday coast defense tasks, so as to establish a new-type inshore defensive combat system.\n\nChina has an 18,000km-long coastline to guard. The new-type frigate is able to engage in low-intensity conflicts and carry out patrol, escort and fishing protection tasks in key waters. It makes the military force structure more reasonable, shows greater flexibility in carrying out combat tasks, and will soon become the main combat equipment for base defense.\n\nMoreover, the large-scale commissioning of the new-type frigate was expected to exert considerable effects on the PLAN\u2019s combat thinking, methods of operation, training, management and application, talent cultivation and battlefield construction.\n\nThe long coastline needs to be patrolled, the disputes over several islands need to be solved, and the maritime transportation routes need to be protected. Guided missile frigate is the most economic choice if those issues need to be solved by force.\n\nAccording to a ranking by the British website Naval Technology, the Type-056 is one of the world's 10 best modern corvettes along with Sweden's Visby class and Germany's K130 Braunschweig class. Cao Weidong, a researcher at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, said despite the Type-056 class being smaller compared with frigates, it will be as powerful as frigates in battles in coastal waters thanks to its stealth design and strong firepower.\n\nBecause the ship's weapons and electronic systems are relatively simple, many international sources classify it as \"corvettes\" (light frigates) rather than \"frigates\". In fact, the Chinese Navy's original intention to develop the Type 056 frigate was also to replace the Type 037 hunting submarine, performing offshore patrol, escort, search and rescue tasks. For quite a long time, the Type 037 submarine hunting submarine has been the main battleship of the Chinese Navy's offshore defense, and has built more than 100 ships. However, the type 037 submarine hunting ship has a small tonnage and poor long-range combat capabilities, making it difficult to perform combat missions in far-off sea areas. After the 1990s, the Chinese Navy built several 053H frigates to perform such tasks, but the 053H frigate tactical and technical indicators had fallen behind. It is difficult to meet the needs of the battlefield in the new century. In this case, the 056 frigate appeared.\n\nThe first 056 frigate was started in 2011, launched in 2012, and delivered to the Navy in 2013. From a practical point of view, compared with the 037 frigate, the 056 frigate had a larger tonnage, more internal space, and can carry more supplies and materials, which is conducive to long-duty maritime operations. The crew's long-distance sea mission execution environment has been improved and efficiency has been improved. The ship was loved by the troops and became an ideal replacement for the 037 hunting submarine. Since then, the Type 056 frigate has entered a period of high-speed construction. It is reported that within about 9 years from 2011 to 2019, about 70 Type 056 frigates were built. On average, about 8 ships per year, and this speed can be said to be very amazing.\n\nAlong with rapid construction, the Type 056 frigate also developed a series of improved and modified ships. For example, in use, the army found that the 30mm single-barrel remote-control naval gun was not very useful and the price was relatively expensive. Large-caliber machine guns can be used for patrol tasks. Therefore, the latest batch of 14.5-mm naval machine guns was used instead. Considering that there are many advanced AIP submarines in the first island chain, the anti-submarine type was developed for this type 056. It is the first domestic surface ship equipped with active / passive towed line sonars, improving the ship's ability to resist modern quiet submarines. In order to cooperate with the advanced underwater acoustic system, the 056 anti-submarine type has been replaced with a new type of anti-submarine missile. The new missile uses a turbojet engine with a longer range and stronger attack capabilities. Sonar, better detection performance. The 056 anti-submarine service effectively improved the Chinese Navy's offshore anti-submarine combat capabilities.\n\nExports\nThe Type 056 1,440-ton class corvette is available for the export market with Bangladesh having ordered at least two ships and the Nigerian Navy ordering the P18N offshore patrol vessel with a full load displacement of 1,800 tons. In October 2012, the first ship P18N in Wuhan shipyard started. In 2013, Bangladesh and China signed a purchase for a group of vessels contract, believed to consist of two frigates, two patrol boats and six large patrol boats.\n\nType C13B [B for Bangladesh] is one of two light frigates ordered by the Bangladesh Navy in 2013. The ship was improved on the basis of Type 056. It replaced the weapon and radar system different from the domestic version and cancelled the anti-submarine capability. The most advanced frigate in the media, once known as China's export, its shape has been fully integrated with the overall trend of international light frigates. Although there is no such new trend as the chasing wind, the high cost performance has won the praise of the Bangladesh Navy. Two more ships have been added.\n\nThe Thai Navy's Pattani-class OPV bears a resemblance to the subsequent Chinese Type 056 corvette / light frigate, though the later is up-gunned relative to the the Thai OPV, with four YJ-3/C803 ASM and a FL-3000N RAM launcher aft, while the former has a much taller superstructure. Built for the Royal Thai Navy by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, each OPV cost about US$50 million. The vessels were commissioned in 2006-2007.\n\nIn November 2014 China completed sea trials of a offshore patrol ship on order for the Nigerian Navy that will assist in suppressing the growing threat of piracy off West African shores. The vessel was the first of two acquired by the Nigerian Navy to bolster its maritime surveillance, patrolling, search-and-rescue and to counter piracy. The patrol ship was launched by state-owned shipbuilder China Shipbuilding & Offshore International Co (CSOC) in January 2014, and was taken for sea trials by affiliated shipyard Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry.\n\nThe second patrol ship was built by CSOC in China but would be outfitted at the naval shipyard in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, in a technology transfer arrangement. According to specifications provided by CSOC, the ship has a full load displacement of 1,800 tonnes and can go 21 knots. The vessel can accommodate 75 crew, has 20 days endurance, and a standard range of 3,000 nautical miles.\n\nA computer-generated image issued by the Nigerian Navy suggested that the ship will have a helicopter hangar and landing deck. The weapons fit comprises a single 76mm NG-16-1 gun with a TR47 fire-control radar, as well as pairs of 30mm and 20mm guns. Nigerian Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Dele Ezeobam told reporters in January 2014 that the F 91 would be handed over mid-2014.\n\nThe Nigerian Navy is standing up to a host of challenges it faces in the Gulf of Guinea. Prior to 2009 before it commissioned the Sea Eagle-class patrol boats, the navy struggled to counter the often heavily armed pirates of West Africa. The two patrol ships is the latest in a string of measures to wrest back control of its seas from criminal groups.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2015, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "Unknown", "string": "00.00.000.000.000.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 056A Class; Jiangdao Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Corvette"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding\nCSSC Huangpu Wenchong Shipbuilding\nWuchang Shipyard\nLiaonan Shipyard"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "2016-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "60 - 73 men"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "The Type 056A is a anti-submarine warfare configuration of the Type 056 Corvette.

Although using the Flying Leopard designation, the FL-3000N is actually a different missile system than the FL-2000(V) shown earlier. In fact, the only commonality shared by both SAM system is the launcher design, and even the launchers differ in size due to the different diameters of the missiles used in the systems.\n\nInstead of using QW-1 Vanguard MANPADs, the FL-3000N system uses the HHQ-10 (Red Flag 10) naval surface to air missile developed from TY-90 missile. The diameter of the missile is enlarged by a third, but the most important design difference is its guidance system. The FL-3000N missile utilizes a combined guidance system that incorporates both passive radio frequency (RF) guidance and imaging infrared (ImIR) guidance. There are a pair of horn like protrusions mounted on the ImIR seeker at the tip of the missile, and these two protrusions are the passive RF seeker. An optional ImIR only guidance is also available and the missile is a fire and forget weapon.\n\nThe fire control system (FCS) of FL-3000N can simultaneously control two launchers, and can be integrated into other FCS on board ships. Alternatively, FL-3000N is also capable being directly controlled by other FCS on board ships. The system is usually fully automatic without human intervention, but manual operation can be inserted when needed.\n\nThe primary launching system of FL-3000N is a 24-cell launcher, developed from FLS-1. An optional extra magazine with automated loading system is available for larger warships when there is enough space provided. On smaller surface combatants where space is limited, the extra magazine with the automated loading system is eliminated and the reload is done manually. To further utilize confined space, an 8-cell launcher and a quadruple launcher are also available.

The biggest difference between Type 904B and its predecessor Type 904A is the addition of hangar onboard Type 904B, where Type 904A only had a landing platform. Other improvements include the replacement of older twin gun mounts by new H/PJ15 single 30 mm gun mounts and more advanced electronics such as radars.\n\nAs the 904 supply ship is emergency construction, there were many deficiencies in the design, especially in the high sea conditions, the supply capacity is very limited. Fuxianhu (888) is a fixed-point [ie, island] supply ship built by the Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) for the PLA Navy. The ship was launched on 25 December 2006 and commissioned by the South Sea Fleet in 2007. Fuxianhu was based on the hull design and propulsion system of the Qiandaohu (Fuchi) class fleet replenishment ship, but with a smaller displacement (~15,000 tonnes). The ship was designed to transport personnel and supplies from mainland to the remote islands in the South China Sea.\n\nUnlike the normal replenishment ship, Fuxianhu does not have the fuel and stores rigs for underway replenishment. Instead, the ship carries six four landing craft (LCVP) at amidships and two small utility boats at stern to ferry personnel and supplies between the mother ship and shore. The ship replaced the older Dayuan class supply ships built in the 1980s for the similar role. Fuxianhu has a large single-spot flight deck to support one medium-size helicopter such as Z-8 and Ka-28, but has no hanger. Its armament includes a Type 76F twin-37mm AAA gun, with a range of 8.5km for airborne targets.\n\nNATO codename is DANYAO class [Danyao = ammunition]. Support ship built at Guangzhou, and launched on 28 December 2006. The ship is equipped with two pairs of davits, capable of handling small landing craft, and a flight deck for medium helicopters. Potential roles for the ship include resupply of the Spratly and Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. Following sea trials in 2007, the ship is reported to have been commissioned in late 2007 and to be based in the South Sea Fleet.\n\nRather than fleet replenishment missions, this type combined with comprehensive supply ship in the Chinese Navy as an island replenishment ship, the same as a supply ship, but the primary duty is to transport goods to islands. Because this ship is built like a replenishment ship, the hull and superstructure arrangement is similar to the underway replenishment type. However, the center of the ship has boat davits, fro a total of four units are equipped with a transport craft to land supplies. As large ships cannot approach an atoll, transport craft are used for replenishment of the port facility.\n\nThe ship had 76 F type 37 mm twin mount guns, and 14.5 mm twin machine guns mounted on the rear structure. Hangar with a Z-8A transport helicopter was set up, but the Fushun Lake is replaced the hangar with a helicopter flight deck. Fushun Lake is designed with emphasis on military capacities and goods transport capacity to advance base ( Spratly Islands, such as personnel and supplies).\n\nType 904B fixed-point supply ship\nOn September 26, 2014, the Guangzhou Shipyard International Shipyard launched the first modified 904B fixed-point supply ship, its basic design and Fuxian Lake similar, but back to the helicopter hangar, to further strengthen the helicopter operating capacity; 904B in July 10, 2015 enlisted, named the mountain Hill (961). In January 2015, internet photos showed the Guangzhou Shipyard International plant there were more 904-type fixed-point supply ship in the construction. As the sovereignty issue intensified between China and Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries in the South China Sea, China also expanded the island of reefs, the island reef fixed supply demand increased, so 904B fixed-point supply ship will continue work.\n\nThe biggest differences between the Type 904B supply ship Luguhu (Hull No. 962) and its predecessor Type 904A supply ship Fuxianhu are that, instead of the portal frame type platform, which is specific to the comprehensive supply ship, on the supply ship Luguhu, there are two davits mounted on each side in the middle section of the ship and a hangar which enhances the vertical replenishment capacity. The ship is designed to provide material supply for the troops stationed in the Nansha islands, and undertake such tasks as providing supply for a ship formation and maritime medical aid at a certain degree.\n\nThe hull and bridge fuller, the chimney also changed from the previous two, the rear mast is between the two chimney. The installation of the helicopter hangar, apparently in order to stay away from the mainland where the vertical supply is needed. The power system may also be improved.\n\nThe 904B-type transport supply ship relative to the A-type has improved performance. Sea supplies are mainly to supplement the warships in combat or sailing in the consumption of oil supplies and so on. Supply the main sub-cargo and dry goods two categories. Liquid cargo is mainly warships of diesel, aviation fuel, machine lubricants, fresh water and so on. Dry goods are mainly a variety of models of ammunition, food, machinery spare parts, spare weapons, additional soldiers, etc. Its displacement is still 15,000 tons, storage of fuel and fresh water more than 10,000 tons, food, ammunition and other materials more than 1,000 tons.\n\nThe 904 B-type self-defense firepower has significantly enhanced. The ship and the ship's two 37-mm machine guns, facelift into 2011 just developed H / PJ15 single tube 30 mm hand-mounted naval gun. The gun uses the LLP12A new fire control system developed by Northern Industries 206, with radar and optoelectronic channels, equipped with automatic photoelectric guidance station, all aspects of performance are far above the 37 mm machine gun. The supply ship is also equipped with a number of 14.5 mm machine guns, used to deal with the threat of close range.\n\nThe internal facilities are more complete. 904B-type superstructure is much larger, the internal space is also larger, staff living area and equipment are stronger than the older generation. It can not have a complete processing workshop, repair shop, and even a female dedicated cabin.\n\nThe ship's self-defense capability is relatively weak, in fact, from the use of 904A point of view, 904B no need to focus on independent combat capability. These supply ships are basically in the first island chain within the supply activities, and these waters is basically the Chinese Air Force's combat power is easy to cover, as the comprehensive supply ship do their own work.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1992, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "AF DANYAO TYPE 904A B CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.016.049.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 904B Class; NATO: Dayun Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "General Stores Issue Ship"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Jiangnan Shipyard"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "1992-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "240"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "171.1 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "24.8 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "9.0 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Full Load", "value": "15,000 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "Name"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "2 x Diesel Engines"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "9000 hp"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "22 knots"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "10,000 NM"}]}, {"name": "Gun Weapon Systems", "sections": [{"name": "Gun Weapon System #1", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "Type 76"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Twin 37mm Naval Gun"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "37mm"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "4 x Type 76 Twin 37mm Naval Guns"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "The Type 76 twin 37mm naval gun is a small caliber naval artillery piece created by China for anti-aircraft and anti-surface purposes.\nThe Type 76 is a further development of the Type 65.

All three were commissioned into service in 2003 to replace the five older Island-class patrol vessels.\n\n\nTyne was featured in the first episode of the BBC series Empire of the Seas, \"How the Navy Forged the Modern World, Heart of Oak\", presented by Dan Snow.\n\nThe ships have large working decks to allow the vessels to cope in several roles, such as disaster relief, fire fighting, rescue work, and interception of other vessels. For this purpose a crane capable of lifting 25 tonnes (28 tons) is fitted, to enable standard containers to be used. The deck is also large enough to permit the transport of other craft such as oil spill recovery tractors and landing craft.\n\nHer affiliations included North Tyneside Council, St Catherines Primary School, Hadrian Special Needs Primary School, TS Caledonia (Peterhead Sea Cadets unit), TS Tyne (Newburn Sea Cadets unit), and the Worshipful Company of Butchers.\n\nAside from her day to day fishery protection duties, Tyne was occasionally been called upon to undertake escort roles in the UK Area of Interest, two such examples occurred in the autumn of 2016 when Tyne was twice assigned to escort Russian warships through the English Channel.\n\nIn March 2017 it was announced that Tyne would be manned by personnel usually assigned to Hunt-class mine countermeasures vessel; this would allow her

Type 071 provides the PLAN with capabilities and flexibility not found in its previous landing ships.\n\nType 071 landing platform dock (LPD) is a new class of amphibious warfare vessels built by Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding, a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), for the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\n\nThe Type 071 LPD is primarily deployed in amphibious landing missions and can also conduct humanitarian aid and civilian evacuation missions.\n\nThe first LPD in the series, Kunlun Shan (998), was launched in December 2006 and commissioned in November 2007. Jinggang Shan (999), the second vessel in the series, was floated out in November 2010 and was inducted into service in October 2011.\n\nThe third ship in the class, Changbai Shan (989), was launched in September 2011 and entered service with the PLAN in September 2012. Yimeng Shan (988) was launched in January 2015 and commissioned in February 2016.\n\nA modified variant of the Type 071 LPD was offered by the China State Shipbuilding & Trading Corp (CSTC) consortium for the Royal Malaysian Navy.\n\nType 071 LPD ships feature a unique hull platform offering large dock space. The ship also offers a dedicated space for medical care and is equipped with a freshwater supply system. The stabilizers fitted to the vessel reduce roll and improve the stability in high sea states.\n\nThe high volumes of internal space support the installation of additional communications systems, which make the ship a fleet command and control center during amphibious operations.\n\nThe Type 071 LPD has a length of 210m, a beam of 28m, and a draft of 7m. The full load displacement of the vessel is 25,000t.\n\nThe amphibious warfare ship features a vehicle deck, well-deck, landing deck, and a hanger. It can carry a combination of marines, vehicles, landing craft, and helicopters.\n\nThe vehicle deck can house amphibious assault vehicles including ZBD05 amphibious IFV, and ZTD-05 amphibious assault tracked armored vehicles. The stern ramp, two side doors, and ramps allow rapid loading of the vehicles and equipment.\n\nThe good deck houses up to four landing craft air-cushioned (LCAC), which can transfer vehicles or marines to the shore at high speed. The LCAC is launched by flooding the docking area. The vessel can also carry landing craft on port/starboard davits.\n\nThe stern helicopter deck offers two landing spots for supporting the operations of two Z-8 (SA 321 Super Frelon) transport helicopters. The twin-door cantilever hangar can house up to four Z-8 helicopters.\n\nThe LPD also has the capacity to carry a marine battalion, including up to 800 marines and associated equipment and supplies.\n\nThe bow deck is installed with an AK-176 76mm naval gun system. The vessel is also armed with four 30mm AK-630 close-in weapon systems (CIWS).

The design represented a major advance in Soviet fleet aviation over the Kiev-class carriers, which could only launch VSTOL aircraft. The Soviet Union's classification for the class was as a heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser, which permits the ships to transit the Turkish Straits without violating the Montreux Convention, however, the Chinese variants are classified as aircraft carriers.\n\nBecause of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the three Kuznetsov-class ships were built over a protracted construction period of almost four decades. Two ships were originally laid down at the Nikolayev South Shipyard in the Ukrainian SSR, to be followed by the first of the Ulyanovsk-class nuclear-powered supercarriers. Only the lead ship Admiral Kuznetsov had been commissioned when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and the ship now serves in the Russian Navy. The construction of her sister ship Varyag was abandoned until 1998, when an independent Ukraine sold the uncompleted ship to China for use as a floating casino, along with a complete set of blueprints. Varyag was eventually completed and commissioned in 2012 as China's first aircraft carrier, the Type 001 aircraft carrier Liaoning.

The class is projected to replace the Soviet-era Delta III, Delta IV, and Typhoon classes in Russian Navy service.\n\nDespite being a replacement for many types of submarines, the Borei-class submarines are much smaller than those of the Typhoon class in both volume and crew (24,000 tons opposed to 48,000 tons and 107 people as opposed to 160 for the Typhoons) and are in terms of class more accurately a follow-on to for the Delta IV-class SSBNs.\n\nThe first design work on the project started in the mid-1980s and the construction of the first vessel started in 1996. Previously, a short-lived, smaller parallel design appeared in the 1980s with the designation Project 935 Borei II. A new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) called the R-39UTTH Bark was developed in parallel. However, the work on this missile was abandoned and a new missile, the RSM-56 Bulava, was designed. The submarine needed to be redesigned to accommodate the new missile, and the design name was changed to Project 955. The vessels were developed by Rubin Design Bureau are being built by Russia's Northern shipyard Sevmash in Severodvinsk. Because of the repeated failures during Bulava test launches, some experts suggested that the Borei submarines could instead be armed with R-29RMU Sineva SLBMs, already in active duty with the Delta IV-class submarines.\n\nIt has been reported that the arrival of the Borei class will enable the Russian Navy to resume strategic patrols in southern latitudes that have not seen a Russian missile submarine for 20 years.\n\nBorei class includes a compact and integrated hydrodynamically efficient hull for reduced broadband noise and the first-ever use of pump-jet propulsion on a Russian nuclear submarine. The noise level is to be five times lower when compared to the third-generation nuclear-powered Akula-class submarines and two times lower than that of the U.S. Virginia-class submarines. The acoustic signature of Borey is significantly stealthier than that of the previous generations of Russian SSBNs, nevertheless, the USN has been able to identify the main noise emitter, i.e. the hydraulic pump. As the pump ages, it tends to become noisier, allowing for easier detection of the submarine.\n\nThe Borei submarines are approximately 170 meters (560 ft) long, 13 meters (43 ft) in diameter, and have a maximum submerged speed of at least 46 kilometers per hour (25 km; 29 mph). They are equipped with a floating rescue chamber designed to fit in the whole crew. Smaller than the Typhoon class, the Boreis were initially reported to carry 12 missiles but are able to carry four more due to the decrease in mass of the 36-ton Bulava SLBM (a modified version of the Topol-M ICBM) over the originally proposed R-39UTTH Bark. Cost is some \u20bd23 billion (USD$890 million), in comparison the cost of an Ohio-class SSBN was around US$2 billion per boat (1997 prices).\n\nEach Borey includes 1.3 million units and mechanisms. Its construction requires 17 thousand tons of metal which are 50 % more than the Eiffel Tower. The total length of pipelines is 109 km and the length of cable routes is 600 km. 10 thousand rubber plates cover the hull of the boat.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2013, "countryOfOrigin": "Russia (RUS)", "proliferation": "Russian Federation", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Russian Federation"], "dis": {"name": "SSBN BOREY PROJECT 955 CLASS", "string": "01.04.222.001.026.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative designations", "value": "Borei Class; Project 955 Class; Project 955A Class; Project 955B Class; Dolgoruky Class."}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine"}, {"name": "Builders", "value": "Sevmash, designed by Rubin"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "107 (55 off. + 52 enl.)"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "By 2022 Russian Navy will operate a total of eight Borei class ballistic missile submarines.

Construction is expected in 2012. This will be the main surface combatant of the future PLA Navy.\"\n\nAt least one Chinese source of uncertain reliability predicted the Type 052D would have a vertical launch system with a a total of 96 new missile interceptors [16 VLS system with six VLS with 96 VLS cells] , and eight new Eagle 12e anti-ship cruise missiles with a range of about 180-240 km. The ship was projected to have a top speed of 32 knots, and an endurance of 14,000 nautical miles. The ship was projected to have a light displacement of 9500 tons, and a full load displacement of 12,000 tons. The length was reported as 180 meters, a beam of 20 meters, and a draft of 6.5 meters.\n\nEven if these specifications were little more than wishful thinking, they are indicative of an expectation that China would eventually deploy a locally designed surface combatant with a displacement of about 10,000 tons, significantly larger than the 7,000 tons of the Type 052. Whether the Type 052D is this vessel, or whether something larger remains in the wings, remained unclear.\n\nType 052D \"Red Aegis\" improvements over Type 052C destroyer\n\nLarger main gun: 130 mm vs. 100 mm\nMore secure communication: Chinese Link 16 vs. Link 11/TADIL-A equivalent\nLarger and more advanced phased array radar: Flat AESA vs. Convex AESA radar\nMore numerous and versatile VLS (vertical launch system): 64 versatile VLS cells vs. 48 AAW VLS cells\nThe new destroyers are equipped with two 32-unit vertical launch systems capable of launching HQ-9B air-defense missiles, anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles. The original YJ-62 missile launchers used on the Type 052C do not appear to be present on the new destroyer. It has been speculated that the Type 052D could be equipped with a naval-style version of the DH-10 land-attack cruise missile.\n\nThe new-type guided missile destroyer \"Kunming\" was delivered and commissioned to the Navy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLAN) on 21 March 2014. The \"Kunming\" with hull number 172, is the new generation of China-made guided missile destroyers. It has strong capacity in air defense and naval warfare.\n\nThe layout of the 052D destroyer is similar to that of the earlier 052C, but the superstructure of the 052D slopes inward at a greater angle, providing reduced radar cross-section. Some analysts have said that the overall performance of 052D destroyers is superior to that of Japan's Atago-class destroyers, South Korea's Sejong the Great-class destroyers and the U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. But compared with Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, China's type 052D destroyers are inferior in terms of quantity, displacement and ship-based guided missiles. China needs to build larger models, including a 10,000-ton guided-missile destroyer. Furthermore, the country needs an increase in the quantity of guided-missile destroyers, as China will build more aircraft carriers in the future. Since China does not currently have cruisers, larger guided-missile destroyers are needed to play the role of cruisers.\n\nType 052D, the first of which commissioned in 2014, is a newer design than the DDG-57 Arleigh Burke, but both vessels are very good looking and capable. However, there are characteristics of the Burke IIA that are noteworthy and important, despite aesthetics. The Burke IIA has 96 VLS cells the Type 052D has 64. The Burke IIA carries two helicopters, the Type 052D carries one. The slope on the side panels of the Burke IIA provide better radar dispersion, because they are sloped more, particularly above the main deck, and also with the \"raked\" mast. The bow Sonar on the Burke IIA is much more powerful than that on the Type 052D. The wider beam on the Burke IIA allows for better handling, particularly in rough sea states. The AEGIS system and cooperative engagement capabilities on the Burke IIA are very well known, understood, and proven. The effectiveness of the new APARs and the combat system on the Type 052D remain unknown.\n\nAbout 160 meters long and with a beam of 18 meters [versus 157 and 18 meters for the DDG-51], the Type 052D is slightly larger than its predecessor, the Type 052C, and is believed to displace slightly over 6,000-7,000 tons [rather less than the 9,200 ton Arleigh Burke]. The vessel uses the Type 346 Active Phased Array Radar System and a Type 518 L-band long-range radar. The main 100mm gun on the Type 052C, which was reportedly unreliable, has been replaced by a new PJ-38 130mm gun. The vessel also has a helicopter-landing platform [and probably a hangar for two helicopters, as the Type 52C] and the Chinese Type 730 counterpart to the US Close-In Weapon System.\n\nThe 130 mm gun was developed by the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of Zhengzhou (Zhengzhou 713 Institute), and produced by by the 2nd Machinery Factory (Baotou,Inner Mongolia). The original design used a single tube dual link ammunition handling and water-cooled systems; the barrel length (with breech) is 70 calibers. Using fully automatic loading gear teh gun has a rate of fire 40 rounds / minute. The range of non-guided shells is about 30 kilometers. The entire gun has a weight (excluding peripherals) greater than 50 tonnes, including the stealth housing. The design of this gun is thought to be based on the proven technologies of the Russian AK-130 130 mm twin-barrel gun, mainly the mechanical design, which is a weak element in Chinese ship-borne guns. The gun electrical control and aiming servo system are dependent on a new localization design.\n\nOne of the most moving episodes in the Chinese blockbuster Wolf Warrior 2 is the one in which the captain of a Type 052D guided-missile destroyer shouts \"Fire!\" to order the launch of supersonic cruise missiles to hit rebel troops in an imaginary African nation holding Chinese hostages. However, this scenario could not have happened in real life because in the Gulf of Aden there have been no Type 052D destroyers-now considered the most capable combat ship in the People's Liberation Army Navy. Instead, the Navy has sent other vessels to the once pirate-plagued waters to protect civilian vessels for nearly 11 years. That changed as the Navy decided to dispatch a Type 052D to take part in its latest escort mission.

The ships are primarily designed for operations within littoral zones to protect Russia's vast coastal areas. Due to the small tonnage, they can operate even within shallow parts of oceans and seas and Russia's river system. The export variant is known as Project 21632 Tornado.\n\nIn August 2010, some information about the newly modified Project 21631, dubbed as Buyan-M, was published. The Project 21631 ships are said to be an up-to-date variant of Project 21630 Buyan small artillery ship, armed with the nuclear-capable Kalibr cruise missiles (SS-N-27 Sizzler) with a claimed range of at least 1,500 km and electronic countermeasure equipment. Ships of Project 21631 are designed to defend the national economic zones of Russia. The ship's small size and displacement enable them to operate within inland river systems, including traversing the Moscow Canal which allows them to deploy to various seas around European Russia. This is a particular advantage for the Buyan-M series, because while the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) prohibits long-range cruise missiles from operating on land they can operate from ships, so a river-based corvette can deploy missiles without being subject to restrictions.

The first aircraft carrier commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force, she is classified as a training ship, intended to allow the Navy to experiment, train and gain familiarity with aircraft carrier operations.\n\nOriginally laid down in 1985 for the Soviet Navy as the Kuznetsov-class aircraft cruiser Riga, she was launched on 4 December 1988 and renamed Varyag in 1990. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, construction was halted and the ship was put up for sale by Ukraine. The stripped hulk was purchased in 1998 and towed to the Dalian naval shipyard in northeast China.\n\nThe ship was rebuilt and commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) as Liaoning on 25 September 2012. Its Chinese ship class designation is Type 001. In November 2016, the political commissar of Liaoning, Commodore Li Dongyou, stated that Liaoning was combat ready.\n\nThe Kuznetsov-class ships were originally designated by the Soviet Navy as \"\u0442\u044f\u0436\u0451\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0435\u0440\" (tyazholiy avianesushchiy kreyser, TAKR or TAVKR), meaning \"heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser\". In addition to aircraft, the ships were designed to carry P-700 Granit anti-ship cruise missiles that also form the main armament of the Kirov-class battlecruisers. This multirole capability allowed the ships to avoid classification as aircraft carriers, thus allowing them to pass through the Turkish Straits between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Under the Montreux Convention, aircraft carriers larger than 15,000 tons are not permitted to pass through the Straits, but there is no displacement limit on other types of capital ship from Black Sea powers.\n\nIn contrast, the People's Liberation Army Navy considers Liaoning to be an aircraft carrier. Since China is not located on the Black Sea and thus not considered a Black Sea power under the Montreux Convention, it does not need and cannot use the tonnage exemption for non-aircraft carrier capital ships. The ship was completed as an aircraft carrier, and cruise missiles were never installed. Liaoning is equipped only with air defence weapons and must use its aircraft for surface attack.\n\nModernization and refit\n701st Institute was tasked to redesign Varyag with Zhu Yingfu (\u6731\u82f1\u5bcc) and Wu Xiaoguang (\u5434\u6653\u5149) were assigned respectively as the general designer and deputy general designer. Wang Zhiguo (\u738b\u6cbb\u56fd) was assigned as the general system engineer, and Yang Lei (\u6768\u96f7) was assigned the general supervisor. The workload of converting Varyag for operational use was equivalent to building ten new destroyers. Varyag was moved in June 2005 to a dry dock at Dalian (38.935\u00b0N 121.6141\u00b0E). Her hull was sandblasted, scaffolding erected, and the ship's island was painted in a red marine primer to treat metal corrosion.\n\nObservers have noted the installation of Type 348 active electronically scanned array (AESA) Radar (four arrays) and Sea Eagle radar.[citation needed] The air defence system consists of the Type 1130 CIWS and the FL-3000N missile system. The anti-ship missile tubes would not be used, freeing up internal space for hangar or storage use. Russia has explored similar modifications to her sister ship Admiral Kuznetsov.\n\nOn 8 June 2011, General Chen Bingde made the first public acknowledgement of the ship's refit.

On 25 November 2012, China announced that J-15s had made five successful arrested landings on Liaoning. In June 2013, a second round of flight tests began on board Liaoning, with personnel from the fleet air arm of the Brazilian Navy providing carrier training support to the PLAN.\n\nIn August 2014, based on an article from Chinese state media, Western news outlets reported that two pilots had been killed testing jets slated to operate from Liaoning. Chinese military officials stated such reports were misleading, and clarified that deaths were in fact unrelated with tests on the carrier. The original Chinese article from Xinhua also did not link the deaths with the J-15 nor mention any loss of such aircraft.\n\nIn August 2014, the Chinese-language Shanghai Morning Post listed that Liaoning would carry 36 aircraft: 24 Shenyang J-15 fighters, six Changhe Z-18F anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, four Changhe Z-18J airborne early warning helicopters and two Harbin Z-9C rescue helicopters. The Chinese carrier aircraft inventory is similar to a balanced combat and support aircraft approach intended for Soviet aircraft carriers, which supported nuclear submarines, large surface combatants, and land-based strike bombers performing anti-access roles. The air wing lacks long-range radar and anti-submarine fixed-wing aircraft, needing support from shore-based aircraft such as Tupolev Tu-154 ASW and Shaanxi Y-8 AWACS aircraft. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that J-15s will have below normal range and armament when operating from the carrier, due to limits imposed by the ski-jump takeoff system. The lack of a carrier onboard delivery aircraft like the United States Navy (USN) Grumman C-2 Greyhound also limits logistics capabilities. Liaoning would need extensive land-based support to oppose a USN carrier strike group; however, it would be potent against the Vietnam People's Navy and the Philippine Navy. Deficiencies will likely be corrected with future aircraft carriers, which are expected to be larger with conventional takeoff decks and catapult launching for heavier fighters, plus fixed-wing radar and anti-submarine patrol aircraft."}]}, {"name": "Radars", "properties": [{"name": "1 x Top Plate (Fregate MAE-3) air search", "value": "The Fregat, Top Plate and Top Steer NATO codename, is a family of 3D, 360-degree/full-coverage ship-based radar systems developed for the Soviet Union Navy and designed to provide surveillance and detection of surface and airborne targets and to deliver target designation data to weapon systems. The Fregat radar system can operate effectively in intense jamming and countermeasures environments. Moreover, the radar system also provides identification friend or foe (IFF). \nThe Fregat family of radar systems features automatic target tracking and built-in self-diagnosis system. The radar system is made of line replaceable units that can be removed with ease in the event of a malfunction. The radars developed under Fregat family are tailored for a variety of ships depending on their displacement and purpose. The main differences among them are: air surveillance range, number of channels and frequency bands, and weight. Typically, Fregat radars operate in the E-band excepting the lightest Fregat MAE-4k which operates in the H-band. All variants can detect a surface ship at the line-of-sight while the maximum detection range for an airborne target with the radar cross section of a non-stealth fighter aircraft varies from 58 to 230 kilometers.\n\nThe Fregat MAE-3 radar system is intended for medium and large displacement ships. It is an E-band two-channel radar with a maximum instrumented range of 300 kilometers and a maximum vertical detection range of 30 km. Fregat MAE-3 can detect a fighter aircraft at a maximum range of 180 km or a missile at a maximum range of 38 km.

Type 382 radar program had already begun in the early 1990s, before the start of the negotiation of importing Russian Sovremennyy-class destroyer in 1994. Type 382 is designed to be a successor of earlier Type 381, but development had run into technological bottleneck for the next generation passive phased array radar due to the technical and industrial limitations in the early and mid-1990s China had at the time. The import of Russian MR-710 radar had provided a significant boost in the development of Type 382 radar in that designers of Type 382 can borrow ideas of MR-710, and as a result, Type 382 has become a cross between Type 381 and MR-710. L\n\nChinese designers abandoned the development of passive phased array radar and decided to adopt the planar array of MR-710 with the same back-to-back configuration of MR-710, because Chinese industry at the time could not provide a new generation passive phased array with the reliability and performance level required by Chinese navy. The more matured planar array of MR-710 not only provided better reliability, but also proved to be more capable than the domestic Chinese passive phased array designed in the mid-1990s. However, Chinese passive phased array Type 381 does have its advantage over its Russian counterpart in that the equipment below deck is far more compact and reliable. Type 382 design was hence altered to combine the best of two systems by integrating the planar array of MR-710 above the deck and the electronic cabinets and operator consoles of Type 381 below deck together. As a result, the original more than 20 cabinets of MR-710 is drastically reduced on the Type 382. However, the most significant difference between MR-710 and Type 382 is that the former is only a single band radar operates at E-band, while the latter is a dual band radar operates at two frequency bands: S (E/F) and C (G/H) bands. Hence Type 382 also has a name: Sea Eagle (Hai-Ying, \u6d77\u9e70) S/C, named after the frequency bands it operates at.Maximum power of Type 382 is increased to 100 kW from the 90 kW of the original MR-710. while the maximum range against a fighter sized target is increased to 250 km from the original 230 km of MR-710. In addition to stronger power and higher precision, the rotation rate of Type 382 is increased from the original 12/min to nearly 30/min and scan rate is also nearly doubled."}]}], "type": "WEG", "version": 1}, "images": [{"name": "Lia(C).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/d/d0/Lia%28C%29.jpg"}, {"name": "Lia(B).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/0/0b/Lia%28B%29.jpg"}, {"name": "Lia(A).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/0/00/Lia%28A%29.jpg"}], "categories": ["WEG", "Naval Watercraft", "Aircraft Carriers", "China, People's Republic of", "PRO_China", "Sea", "Tier3", "China, People's Republic of", "Sea", "PRO_China"]}, {"title": "Chaho Class North Korean Patrol Boat", "id": 6020, "json": {"tiers": [false, false, true, false], "notes": "The design of this class is based on the Russian P-6 torpedo boat design, but with a steel hull rather than the wooden hull of the P-6.

It was originally built in France for the Russian Navy as part of a contract for two of these warships and underwent sea trials. The contract with Russia was subsequently cancelled by France and an agreement on compensation was reached with the Russian government. Egypt and France eventually concluded a deal to acquire the two warships for roughly 950 million euros. Egypt is considered the first and only country in Africa and the Middle East to possess a helicopter carrier of such type.\n\nThe Russian government placed an order for this and another warship in 2011. The construction of these ships would be shared between both countries, with France building about 60 percent and Russia 40 percent. Work started in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 18 June 2013, and in the Russian Baltiysky Zavod shipyard in St. Petersburg on 4 July 2013. Russia would send its parts to France for final assembly. The ship was originally expected to join the Russian Navy in 2015. After final assembly of the main structures in France the ship was then scheduled to go to St. Petersburg, Russia, for the outfitting of additional Russian-specific weapons and subsystems.\n\nThe Russian acquisition of these two French Mistral-class amphibious assault ships was considered to be the largest defense deal between Russia and the West since World War II.\n\nIn 2014, as criticism of Russian intervention in Ukraine grew, France came under increasing pressure to cancel or suspend the delivery of the two Mistral-class hulls, tentatively named Vladivostok and Sevastopol. Some commentators suggested France try to find alternative customers for the two vessels. In August, 2015, the two governments reached agreement on terms for cancelling the contract; France would keep the ships and fully reimburse Russia.\n\nOn 7 August 2015, a French diplomatic source confirmed that President Hollande had discussed the matter with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi during his visit to Egypt for the inauguration of the New Suez Canal in Ismailia. Subsequently, in October 2015, Egypt and France concluded a deal to acquire the two formerly Russian-bound warships for roughly 950 million euros, which included the costs of training Egyptian crews. Speaking on RMC Radio, Jean-Yves Le Drian, French Defence Minister, said that Egypt had already paid the whole price for the helicopter carriers.\n\nBeginning in February 2016, 180 Egyptian sailors began training in Saint-Nazaire, France, on the newly renamed landing helicopter dock Gamal Abdel Nasser, with the support of the DCNS (Direction des Constructions Navales Services) and STX France instructors and D\u00e9fense Conseil International.\n\nOn 2 June 2016, DCNS delivered the first of these two helicopter carriers acquired by the Arab Republic of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser. The flag transfer ceremony took place in the presence of Egyptian and French Navies\u2019 Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Rabie and Admiral Rogel, Herv\u00e9 Guillou, chairman and chief executive officer of DCNS, Laurent Castaing, chairman and chief executive officer of STX France, and senior Egyptian and French officials. Gamal Abdel Nasser left Saint-Nazaire after a few days with associated support vessels. Before sailing to the vessel's home port of Alexandria, Egypt, the warship participated in a joint exercise between the Egyptian and French Navies. On 16 September 2016, DCNS delivered the second of the two helicopter carriers, Anwar El Sadat, which also participated in a joint exercise with the French Navy before arriving at its home port of Alexandria on 6 October 2016, coinciding with the country's celebrations of the 43rd anniversary of the 1973 October War against Israel.\n\nAircraft\nSince receiving its two Mistral-class carriers, Egypt had issued an international tender for the procurement of new maritime helicopters. The Egyptian Navy and Air Force studied several offers for helicopters to use on both carriers. European and Russian manufacturers entered the bidding procedure; NHIndustries and Airbus Helicopters were reported to have offered their NH90 and Tiger helicopters, while Russian Helicopters offered its Ka-52K helicopter. By May 2017, the tender had reached its final stage, Russian Helicopters stated that it would intermediary enter into pricing negotiations if the company won the tender. In June 2017, Russia announced it had won the tender for providing deck helicopters Ka-52K for the Egyptian Mistral carriers. The head of the FSVTS, Dmitry Shugayev, said that pre-contract work was underway, including final agreement on the helicopter's technical concept and other financial conditions. Egypt is likely to buy the same package intended for the Russian Navy, which includes Ka-52K attack helicopters and Ka-29/31 utility helicopters, before the contract was cancelled by France.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2016, "countryOfOrigin": "Egypt", "proliferation": "Egypt", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Egypt"], "dis": {"name": "LHA 1020 ANWAR SADAT", "string": "01.03.062.054.015.002.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designations", "value": "Anwar El Sadat\n(ex-Sevastopol); BPC; NTCD"}, {"name": "Pennant Number", "value": "L1020"}, {"name": "Laid Down", "value": "1 February 2012"}, {"name": "Launched", "value": "15 October 2013"}, {"name": "Commissioned", "value": "16 September 2016"}, {"name": "Homeport", "value": "Alexandria"}, {"name": "Builders", "value": "STX Europe\nDCNS"}, {"name": "Class", "value": "Mistral class"}, {"name": "Active", "value": "Mistral, Tonnerre, Dixmude\nGamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar El Sadat"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Amphibious assault ship"}, {"name": "Complement", "value": "20 officers, 80 petty officers, 60 quarter-masters"}, {"name": "Troops", "value": "900 (short duration)\n450 (long durations)\n150 (serving as operational headquarters)"}, {"name": "Capacity", "value": "59 vehicles (including 13 AMX Leclerc tanks) or a 40-strong Leclerc tank battalion"}, {"name": "Boats & landing craft carried", "value": "4 CTM (chaland de transport de mat\u00e9riel)\nalternatively, 2 LCAC (Landing Craft, Air Cushion)"}, {"name": "Sensors and processing systems", "value": "DRBN-38A Decca Bridgemaster E250 navigation radar\nMRR3D-NG air/surface sentry radar\n2 optronic fire control systems"}, {"name": "Aircraft Carried", "value": "Former Russian aircraft:\n8 \u00d7 Kamov Ka-52K attack helicopters (Naval version of Ka-52 which is under construction)\n4 \u00d7 Kamov Ka-29TB transport helicopters\n4 \u00d7 Kamov Ka-27P ASW helicopters"}, {"name": "Aviation Facilities", "value": "Helicopter deck and hangar"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "200", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "32", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Draught", "value": "6.3", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Dispacement, Empty", "value": "16,500 tonnes"}, {"name": "Dispacement, Fully Loaded", "value": "21,300 tonnes"}]}, {"name": "Automotive", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 diesel-alternators 16 V32 (6.2 MW) + 1 W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Vaasa auxiliary diesel-alternator 18V200 (3 MW)"}, {"name": "Number of Engines", "value": "3"}, {"name": "Propulsion", "value": "2 Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth thrusters (2 \u00d7 7 MW), 2 five-bladed propellers"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "18.8 knots (35 km/h)"}, {"name": "Range", "value": "10,800 km (5,800 nmi) at 18 knots (33 km/h)\n19,800 kilometres (10,700 nmi) at 15 knots (28 km/h)"}]}, {"name": "Armament", "sections": [{"name": "Weapon Station #1", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "AN/TWQ-1 Avenger"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Surface-to-Air Missile System"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "1989-Present"}, {"name": "Manufacturer", "value": "Boeing"}, {"name": "Proliferation", "value": "Bahrain\n Egypt\n Iraq\n Taiwan - Avenger batteries have been upgraded by integrating CS/MPQ-90 Bee Eye radars\n United States \u2013 U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "4", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "4.95 m"}, {"name": "Width", "value": "2.18 m"}, {"name": "Height", "value": "2.64 m"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "2 (Basic), 3 (STC)"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "3900 kg"}, {"name": "Missile", "value": "FIM-92 Stinger missiles"}, {"name": "Operational Range", "value": "It has an outward targeting range of up to 4,800 m and can engage low altitude enemy threats at up to 3,800 m."}]}, {"name": "Weapon Station #1 Missile", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "FIM-92 Stinger missiles"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Infrared homing Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM)"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "8 per AN/TWQ-1 Avenger Systems giving the vessel a total of 32 missiles"}, {"name": "Warhead", "value": "High explosive annular blast fragmentation"}, {"name": "Warhead Weight", "value": "3 kg"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "1.52 m"}, {"name": "Diameter", "value": "70.1mm"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "15.19 kg"}, {"name": "Engine", "value": "Solid-fuel rocket motor"}, {"name": "Guidance System", "value": "Infrared homing"}, {"name": "Operational Range", "value": "443 km"}]}]}, {"name": "Accommodations", "properties": [{"name": "Note", "value": "The space gained by the use of the azimuth thrusters allowed for the construction of accommodation areas where no pipes or machinery are visible.

It is a multi-mission design; the combination of sensors and weapons suggests the main role of area air defense, with anti-submarine warfare capabilities surpassing previous Chinese surface combatants.\n\nType 055 is expected to undertake expeditionary missions and form the primary escort for Chinese aircraft carriers.\n\nThe United States classifies these ships like cruisers. The United States Navy defines a cruiser as a large multi-mission surface combatant with flag facilities; this suggests the U.S. expects the Type 055 to fulfill a similar role as the Ticonderoga-class cruiser.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army Navy was interested in a large destroyer from at least the late-1960s. A development program, code-named \"055\", initiated in 1976 was canceled in 1983 after encountering insurmountable technical obstacles from industrial underdevelopment; for example, the required gas turbine power plants could neither be produced domestically nor imported at acceptable prices.\n\nIn April 2014, an image emerged of a full-scale mock-up of the Type 055 superstructure - with an enclosed integrated mast for radar and other electronics - at the Chinese naval electronic testing range in Wuhan.\n\nNanchang, the first ship of the class, began construction in 2014 at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai and was commissioned on 12 January 2020. Its first public appearance - preceding commissioning - was during the PLAN's 70th-anniversary parade on 23 April 2019. When launched, Nanchang was among the largest post-Second World War warships launched in East Asia.\n\nType 055 adopts a conventional flared hull with distinctive stealthy features including an enclosed bulbous bow that hides mooring points, anchor chains, and other equipment. The bow and main deckhouse are configured similarly to previous Type 052C/D destroyers. A continuous structure amidship increases internal volume and reduces radar cross-section. The smokestack design reduces both infrared signature and radar cross-section. Chinese sources credit the design as being generally stealthy, with reduced radar, noise, infrared, and electromagnetic radiation signatures.\n\nPower plants\nPropulsive power is generated by four 28 MW QC-280 gas turbines in combined gas and gas arrangements. Additional power may be provided by six 5 MW QD-50 gas turbines.\n\nThe maximum speed is estimated to be 30 knots.\n\nElectronics\nType 055's battle management system may allow integration with carrier strike groups.\n\nThe integrated mast may mount X band radar in four fixed active electronically scanned arrays (AESA). The deckhouse may mount four Type 346B AESA panels; the previous Type 346 was a dual S and C band radar, but the Type 346B may only be S-band as an X-band radar is included. The X band radar may be mounted higher as it is better suited for horizon search and low altitude object detection. The Type 346B arrays can be larger and have higher power when mounted on the deckhouse below the X band radar.\n\nVarious electronic warfare support measures (ESM), electronic countermeasures (ECM), and electro-optic (EO) sensors and datalinks are mounted. They are likely more advanced than those deployed on previous ships.\n\nA deployment port exists for variable depth and towed array sonar. The large bulbous bow likely contains a bow sonar; the Type 055 may mount a larger bow sonar than previous Chinese surface combatants.\n\nArmament\nThe primary armament is missiles carried in 112 universal vertical launch cells (VLS); 64 cells forward and 48 cells aft. The same VLS model is used on the Type 052D destroyer, which is believed to be an implementation of the GJB 5860-2006 standard. The longest variant, with 9-meter cells, is likely used. Type 055 is expected to carry HHQ-9 surface-to-air missiles, YJ-18 anti-ship cruise missiles, CJ-10 land-attack cruise missiles, and missile-launched anti-submarine torpedoes upon entering service.\n\nFuture developments\nIt has been suggested that future variants may be armed with lasers or electromagnetic railguns. Since the current design does not have integrated electric propulsion, installation of integrated electric propulsion will be required for the ship to meet power requirements in the future.\n\nThe universal VLS makes it possible to carry future anti-ballistic missiles (ABM).", "dateOfIntroduction": 2019, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "CG RENHAI TYPE 055 CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.003.015.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 055 destroyer (NATO/OSD Renhai-class cruiser"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Guided Missile Cruiser"}, {"name": "Builders", "value": "Changxingdao-Jiangnan Shipyard\nDalian Shipbuilding Industry Company"}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "1 ship built as of 2021, 6 in total scheduled to be built."}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "280 - 300 men"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "180", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "20", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Draught", "value": "6.6", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Standard", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Displacement, Full Load", "value": "12 000 - 13 000 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "COGAG propulsion system with 4 QC-280 gas turbines (28 MW each) and 6 QD-50 gas turbines (5 MW each)"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "Total: 112 MW (150,000 shp"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "5,000 nmi (9,300 km)"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph)"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "INA"}]}, {"name": "Weapons Station #1", "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "H/PJ-38 130mm Naval Gun"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Naval Gun"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "1 X H/PJ-38 130mm Naval Gun"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "30 mm"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "Designed by the Zhengzhou Mechanical-Electrical Engineering Research Institute (\u90d1\u5dde\u673a\u7535\u5de5\u7a0b\u7814\u7a76\u6240, also known as the 713th Research Institute of the 7th Academy) and manufactured by Inner Mongolia 2nd Machinery Manufacturing Factory (\u5185\u8499\u7b2c\u4e8c\u673a\u68b0\u5236\u9020\u5382), the H/PJ-38 130 mm naval gun was developed from reverse engineering of Soviet AK-130 twin 130 mm naval gun, which was carried out by the same two establishments.

It is the first aircraft carrier to be built in India. The name Vikrant (Sanskrit vikr\u0101nta, literally \"stepping beyond\") means \"courageous\". The motto of the ship is Jayema Sam Yudhi Sprdhah, which is taken from Rigveda 1.8.3 and can be translated as \"I defeat those who fight against me\".\n\nWork on the ship's design began in 1999, and the keel was laid in February 2009. The carrier was floated out of its dry dock on 29 December 2011 and was launched on 12 August 2013. As of 2019, the ship is expected to start sea trials in February 2021 and enter into service in early 2022. The project cost has escalated, by 2014, to \u20b919,341 crore (equivalent to \u20b9230 billion or US$3.2 billion in 2018). With an additional \u20b93,000 crore (US$420 million) authorised for phase III, in 2019.\n\nIt is 262 metres (860 ft) long and 60 metres (200 ft) wide, and displaces about 40,000 metric tons (39,000 long tons). It features a STOBAR configuration with a ski-jump. The deck is designed to enable aircraft such as the MiG-29K to operate from the carrier. It is expected to carry an air group of up to thirty aircraft, which will include up to 24\u201326 fixed-wing combat aircraft,[23] primarily the Mikoyan MiG-29K, besides carrying 10 Kamov Ka-31 or Westland Sea King helicopters. The Ka-31 will fulfill the airborne early warning (AEW) role and the Sea King will provide anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capability.\n\nVikrant is powered by four General Electric LM2500+ gas turbines on two shafts, generating over 80 megawatts (110,000 hp) of power. The gearboxes for the carriers were designed and supplied by Elecon Engineering. The ship's combat management system (CMS) was developed by Tata Power Strategic Engineering Division in collaboration with Weapon and Electronics System Engineering Establishment and MARS, Russia. It is the first CMS developed by a private company for the Indian Navy, was handed over to the Navy on 28 March 2019\n\nIndia considered a number of aircraft for operation from its INS Vikramaditya and the planned indigenous aircraft carrier. India evaluated the Russian Sukhoi Su-33, but chose the lighter Mikoyan MiG-29K as Vikramaditya was smaller and lacked an aircraft catapult. On 18 January 2010, it was reported that India and Russia were close to signing a deal for 29 MiG-29K fighters to operate from IAC-1. In addition, the navy signed a deal for six naval-variants of the HAL Tejas. In June 2012, Flight Global reported that the Indian Navy was considering the use of Rafale M (Naval variant) on these carriers.\nIn December 2016, the navy announced that the HAL Tejas was overweight for carrier operations, and other alternatives would be looked at.\n\nThe ship's completion and commissioning has been delayed several times. Vikrant was originally intended to be delivered in December 2010 and commissioned in 2016. This was later postponed, with sea trials to begin in 2017 and commissioning planned for 2018. In July 2016, the Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) published a 2014 project plan, supplied by the Cochin Shipyard, that shows an expected completion date in 2023, though the Navy hoped to partially commission the ship before this date.\n\nIn December 2017, the Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba announced that the ship was expected to be commence sea trials and be commissioned in 2020.[62][64] In January 2018, Commodore Chowdhary, the principal director of naval design, announced the remaining procurement delays stalling Vikrant's construction had been resolved, and that the carrier would be completed and delivered by December 2018; it would then undergo two years of sea trials before its expected commissioning in October 2020. In July 2019, Vice Admiral Saxena, Controller of Warship Production and Acquisition in the Navy, said that the ship was expected to be delivered by 2021.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2020,

false, true, false], "notes": "INS Vikramaditya (Sanskrit, Vikram\u0101ditya meaning \"Brave as the Sun\") is a modified Kiev-class aircraft carrier and the flagship of the Indian Navy, which entered into service in 2013. She has been renamed in honor of Vikramaditya, a legendary emperor of India.\n\nOriginally built as Baku and commissioned in 1987, the carrier served with the Soviet Navy and later with the Russian Navy (as Admiral Gorshkov) before being decommissioned in 1996. The carrier was purchased by India on 20 January 2004 after years of negotiations at a final price of $2.35 billion. The ship successfully completed her sea trials in July 2013 and aviation trials in September 2013.\n\nShe was commissioned on 16 November 2013 at a ceremony held at Severodvinsk, Russia. On 14 June 2014, the Prime Minister of India formally inducted INS Vikramaditya into the Indian Navy and dedicated her to the nation.\n\nRefurbishment\nThe hull work was completed by 2008 and Vikramaditya was launched on 4 December 2008. Around 99% of the structural work and almost 50% of the cabling work had been completed by June 2010. Almost all of the large equipment, including engines and diesel generators, was installed. A naval MiG-29K prototype aircraft was used to test the deck systems of Vikramaditya in 2010.\n\nAll reconfiguration work was completed at Severodvinsk, Russia; however, it was delayed by three years due to underestimation of the amount of cabling needed. An expert-level discussion on technical and financial matters was held between India and Russia to sort out the issues. The MiG-29K entered operational service with India in February 2010. A compromise was finalized and India was to pay an extra undisclosed amount. Russia was to install new systems instead of repairing the old ones.\n\nOn 1 June 2010, The Times of India reported a naval officer saying: \"With India earlier this year agreeing to the revised refit cost of $2.33 billion for Gorshkov after three years of bitter wrangling since the earlier agreement inked in January 2004 had earmarked only $974 million for it, Russia has appointed a high-level apex committee to oversee the work on the carrier\". The ship was to go for harbor trials by early 2011 to ensure it could be handed over to India by December 2012 or so. Dock trials began on 1 March 2011. The focus of these trials was on the main power generation units and the radio-electronic armament systems, manufactured in India. Indian Navy personnel began training on Vikramaditya in April 2011. On 19 April 2012, it was announced that all internal systems were functioning, and the ship was entirely self-contained. Measurement of the ship's magnetic field and center of gravity were performed before sea trials began.\n\nAs completed, Vikramaditya has a larger full load displacement than when the ship was originally launched in 1982 as Baku. 1,750 out of 2,500 compartments of the ship were re-fabricated, and extensive re-cabling was done to support new radars and sensors. The elevators were upgraded, and two restraining stands were fitted, allowing combat aircraft to reach full power before making a ski jump-assisted short take-off. Three arresting gears were fitted on the aft part of the angled deck, and navigation and carrier-landing aids were added to support fixed-wing \"short take-off but arrested recovery\" (STOBAR) operations.\n\nThe major modifications were to allow Admiral Gorshkov to operate as a STOBAR aircraft carrier in Indian service, as opposed to the STOVL configuration the ship was built as. This involved removal of all the armaments, including the P-500 Bazalt cruise missile launchers and the four Antey Kinzhal surface-to-air missile bins fitted on the ship's bow, to make way for a 14.3\u00b0, full-width ski-jump. The 20-ton capacity aircraft lift beside the ship's island superstructure was unchanged, but the aft lift was enlarged and its lift capacity increased to 30 tons. For STOBAR operations, three 30 m arrestor wires and three restraining gears on the stern of the angled deck were fitted. Sponsons were installed to increase the area of the flight deck, to allow the ski-jump to be fitted, for strengthening of arresting gear and runway area, and to lengthen the after end, which allowed an increase to the length of the landing strip aft of the arresting gear. 234 new hull sections were installed to achieve the desired shape, and the total steel added to carry out these modifications amounted to 2500 tons.\n\nThe superstructure profile was designed to accommodate the fixed phased array scanners of the Soviet Navy's Mars-Passat 3D air search radar system, along with extensive command and control facilities to conduct an aerial campaign. An extensive revamp of sensors was carried out, with long-range air-surveillance radars and advanced electronic warfare suites fitted, which enable the maintenance of a surveillance bubble of over 500 km around the ship. An aft mast was installed to accommodate various communication antennae. These changes needed 2,300 km of new cables and 3,000 km of new pipes.\n\nThe eight original boilers were replaced by a new generation, high-pressure boilers, converted to take diesel fuel utilizing LSHSD instead of furnace fuel oil, each providing a steam capacity of 100 tonnes per hour. The new boilers are highly efficient and have high levels of automation. They power four propellers in four shaft configurations, producing a total thrust of 180,000 horsepower (134,226 kW) at the shaft, providing a top speed of over 30 knots. Six turbo-alternators and six diesel alternators generate 18 MW of electricity to power various equipment. Modern oil-water separators, as well as a sewage treatment plant, were incorporated to meet international standards. Six new Finnish W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 1.5 MW diesel generators, a Global Marine communications system, Sperry Bridgemaster navigation radar, a new telephone exchange, a new data link, and an IFF Mk XI system were added. Hotel services were improved with the addition of two reverse osmosis plants producing 400 tons of freshwater per day, as well as updated refrigeration and air conditioning. A new gallery was installed together with improved domestic services and accommodation for 10 female officers.\n\nCombat systems\nThe combat systems onboard the carrier is controlled by LESORUB-E, the computer-aided action information system. It gathers data from the ship's sensors and data links and creates comprehensive situation awareness. The CCS Mk II communication complex is installed for external communications and the Link II tactical data system enables integration into the Indian Navy's network-centric operations. Modern launch and recovery systems are installed for handling different aircraft \u2013 the LUNA Landing system for MiG-29Ks and the DAPS Landing system for Sea Harriers. The Resistor-E automated air-traffic-control system has been installed, which provides assistance during the approach, landing, and short-range navigation down to a distance of 30 meters short of the flight deck to the pilots. Along with various other sub-systems, it provides navigation and flight data to ship-borne aircraft operating at long distances from the carrier.\n\nWhen delivered, Vikramaditya had yet to be fitted with any onboard armament, leaving her dependent on her battle group for self-defense. This was rectified during the ship's short refit of April\u2013June 2015, when she was fitted with four license-built AK-630 CIWS, and a Barak 1 SAM system stripped from the decommissioned INS Godavari. During the ship's first scheduled major refit in 2017, the Barak 1 system will be replaced with the newly developed Barak 8 long-range air-defense system (LR-SAM), which is currently being tested. It is launched from vertical launch cells and has an operational range of 0.5\u2013100 km. The carrier will carry up to 48 missiles.\n\nThe official expected life span of the ship is 40 years and is unlikely to require any major repair work for at least a decade. Over 70% of the ship and her equipment is new and the remainder has been refurbished.[Sevmash Shipyard, which upgraded the carrier, will provide warranty servicing including maintenance for the next 20 years.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1987, "countryOfOrigin": "India", "proliferation": "India", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["India"], "dis": {"name": "CV VIKRAMADITYA CLASS", "string": "01.03.099.001.001.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "INS Vikramaditya-Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Aircraft Carrier"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Black Sea Shipyard, USSR, and Sevmash, Russia"}, {"name": "Homeport", "value": "INS Kadamba, Karwar"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "1,610 (110 off. + 1,500 enl.)"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length, Overall", "value": "283.0 m"}, {"name": "Length, Waterline", "value": "249.5 m"}, {"name": "Beam, Overall", "value": "51.0 m"}, {"name": "Beam, Waterline", "value": "32.7 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "10.0 m"}, {"name": "Hanger Length", "value": "130.0 m"}, {"name": "Hanger Width", "value": "23.0 m"}, {"name": "Hanger Height", "value": "5.7 m"}, {"name": "Flight Deck", "value": "280.0 m"}, {"name": "Runway Length", "value": "198.0 m"}, {"name": "Runway Width", "value": "4.0 m"}, {"name": "Aircraft Area on deck", "value": "2,400 sq m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Standard", "value": "46,129 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "4 x GTZA 674 geared turbines"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "180,000 total shp"}, {"name": "Shafts", "value": "4 x shafts"}, {"name": "Boilers", "value": "8 x KWG4 turbo pressurized"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "7,000 nm (8,050 mi) at 18 knots"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "29 knots max"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "30 days"}]}, {"name": "Communications", "properties": [{"name": "Communcations System", "value": "1 x Composite Communications System Mk II"}, {"name": "Data Link", "value": "1 x Link 11 Data System"}]}, {"name": "Main Gun System", "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "4 x AK-630 CIWS"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Close-In Weapon System"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "30 mm"}, {"name": "Main Armament", "value": "1 or 2 AO-18 autocannons"}, {"name": "Secondary Armament", "value": "4 x 9A4172 missiles"}, {"name": "Number of Missiles per AK-630 30mm Close-In Weapon System", "value": "4 x 9A4172 missiles per AK-630 CIWS systems"}, {"name": "Number of Missiles Total", "value": "24 x Rafael Barak 1 surface-to-air missile systems."}, {"name": "Barrel Length", "value": "1,629 mm (total)\n1,460 mm (rifled)"}, {"name": "Width", "value": "1,240 mm (mount ring)"}, {"name": "Height", "value": "1,070 mm  (above deck)"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "1,000 kg (gun mount)"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "1", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Action", "value": "Gas-operated rotary cannon"}, {"name": "Elevation", "value": "+88\u00b0 ... -12\u00b0 (50\u00b0/sec)"}, {"name": "Traverse", "value": "\u00b1180\u00b0 (70\u00b0/sec)"}, {"name": "Rate of Fire", "value": "4,000\u20135,000 rounds/min"}, {"name": "Muzzle Velocity", "value": "880\u2013900 m/s"}, {"name": "Maximum Firing Range", "value": "the projectiles self-destruct past 5,000 m (16,000 ft) range"}, {"name": "Effective Firing Range", "value": "4,000 m (aerial)\n5,000 m (maritime)"}, {"name": "Feed System", "value": "Belt: 2,000 rounds (additional 1,000 rounds in reserve feed bin."}, {"name": "Sights", "value": "Radar / TV-optical"}]}, {"name": "Ammunition", "properties": [{"name": "Type", "value": "Rifle"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "30", "units": "mm"}, {"name": "Shell", "value": "HEI-Frag, Frag-T"}, {"name": "Shell Weight", "value": "0.39 kg"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "4,000 per AK-630 30mm Close-In Weapon System (CIWS)."}]}]}, {"name": "Missile Weapon System", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "24 x Barak 1 Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) System"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) System"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "2.1 m"}, {"name": "Diameter", "value": "170 mm"}, {"name": "Wingspan", "value": "685 mm"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "98 kg"}, {"name": "Warhead", "value": "22 kg (blast Fragmentation warhead)"}, {"name": "Operational Range", "value": "0.5 km -

The Chinese variant is known as the Type 033 Romeo. A total of 84 Type 033 submarines were built in China from 1962 to 1984, plus several exported to other countries.\n\nThe Chinese Type 033 incorporated some improvements over the original Romeo, including noise reduction of 20 dB. Sonar on board was also continuously upgraded: the original Soviet sonar was first replaced by domestic Chinese Type 105 sonar, which consequently was replaced by H/SQ2-262A sonar built by No. 613 Factory. Today most of the Type 033 subs have been retired or preserved, with a few remaining in service for training purposes. A total of six Chinese Romeo class submarine variants were developed:\n\nType 6633: Original Chinese built Romeo, China was to have assembled these Romeos from knock-down kits provided by the Soviet Union, 6 were planned, but only 2 were completed. The construction program came to a complete stop when the USSR stopped delivery of parts following the Sino-Soviet split. Construction of the 3rd unit at Wuhan was stopped, and available parts were diverted to complete the first pair, but many parts had to be developed indigenously. The primary improvement of Type 6633 over the original Soviet boats is the use of domestic Chinese batteries, which had slightly superior performance to that of the original Soviet batteries.\n\nType 033: Complete domestic production in China was achieved in 1967, and subsequently the project was renamed the Type 033. However, experience from deployment of completed boats in warmer climates proved that the original Soviet refrigeration and air conditioning system designed for subarctic and arctic area was woefully inadequate for subtropical and tropical regions, so redesigns were needed to improve refrigeration and air conditioning systems, and all boats to be stationed in tropical and subtropical regions went through such a refit. In September 1969 construction of new Type 033s, with improved air conditioning and refrigeration capability, began at Huangpu Shipyard in Guangzhou, eventually, 13 units were completed.\n\nES5A: Upgraded Type 033, with improvements mainly involving the replacement of equipment of Soviet origin with domestic Chinese systems, which includes: QZHA\u201510 (Type 779) attack periscope and QDYA\u201510 (Type 778) general purpose periscope. Addition of H/SQG-2 ranging sonar, Type 063 communication systems, and countermeasure systems. Domestic Chinese Type 801 sonar replaced the original Soviet MARS-24 sonar. The only difference between the Type 801 sonar and the MARS-24 sonar is that there are 24 transducer elements for the Type 801 as opposed to 12 in the original MARS 24, so the Chinese sonar had better accuracy. Domestic Chinese H/SQZ-D reconnaissance sonar (with Type 105 transducers) replaced the original Soviet system, the performance of the SQZ-D is almost identical to the original Soviet sonar it was developed from, except for the sector of scan, which is increased by 15 degrees. Additional noise reduction measures were also adopted. This is the type China originally sold to Egypt in the 1980s.\n\nType 033G: Development of the ES5A, with the incorporation of the capability to launch acoustic homing torpedoes; analog computers installed to achieve automation of, and speeding up of, torpedo fire control calculations that were previously manually calculated. All Chinese Romeos were converted to this standard. The NATO reporting name for this type is rumored to be the Wuhan-class.\nType 033G1: A single Type 033G was modified to carry 6 YJ-1 (CSS-N-4) anti-ship missiles, this variant is called Type 033G1, with the rumored NATO reporting name of Wuhan A. The missile had to be fired while the boat was surfaced, with a total exposure time on the surface of less than 7 minutes. The most significant improvement, however, is the reduction of noise level by 12 dB.\nES5B: Development of the Type 033G, primarily intended for export. This is an upgrade package for Romeo submarine users. The primary improvement of this class is the ability to launch wire guided torpedoes and anti-ship missiles (AShM) while submerged. The program originally begun in the mid-1980s, and Egypt is reported to be the only customer when China won a contract to upgrade its Romeo-class submarine fleet, including both Soviet built and Chinese built units. This is the last type of Chinese Romeo class submarine; with noise reduction of 20 dB to 140 dB in comparison to the 160 dB of the original Soviet Project 633 submarines acquired by China."}], "type": "WEG", "version": 1}, "images": [{"name": "ROMEO_(849)_class_(Egypt)(C).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/a/a3/ROMEO_%28849%29_class_%28Egypt%29%28C%29.jpg"}, {"name": "ROMEO_(849)_class_(Egypt)(B).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/b/b7/ROMEO_%28849%29_class_%28Egypt%29%28B%29.jpg"}, {"name": "ROMEO_(849)_class_(Egypt)(A).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/8/80/ROMEO_%28849%29_class_%28Egypt%29%28A%29.jpg"}], "categories": ["WEG", "Naval Watercraft", "Submarines", "Diesel-Electric Patrol and Attack Submarines", "Tier3", "Egypt", "Sea", "PRO_Egypt"]}, {"title": "Soju Class North Korean Guided Missile Patrol Craft", "id": 10266, "json": {"tiers": [false, false, true, false], "notes": "A total of 15 to 17 units of this class were completed during 1981-1993.

The class is the first diesel-electric submarine to be fully developed within China and also the first Chinese diesel-electric submarine to use the modern teardrop hull shape.\n\nDesigned  for attacking both other submarines and surface ships with torpedoes, the submarine uses a modern teardrop-shape hull for underwater performance. The hull incorporates four rudders and is propelled by a single propeller. The engine is imported from Germany. For quieter operation, the engine was mounted with shock absorbers and the hull is plated in rubber tiles for sound deadening. Development was not without problems, as a lengthy testing period for the first vessel (320) attests. Problems with noise levels and underwater performance led to revisions in the design and only a single boat was ever built to the original specification.\n\nImprovements led to the specification for the Type 039G, which became the bulk of production, with seven of the type entering service. Elimination of the stepped design for the conning tower is the primary visual cue for identification of the G variant. This class has two versions: the original Type 039, Type 039G. The most obvious visual difference between the two types is the conning tower. The Type 039's conning tower is stepped, rising aft. In an effort to shrink the submarine's acoustic signature, the Type 039G's conning tower was given a more conventional shape without any step.\n\nWeapons:\nPrimary weapon for the Type 039 is the 533 mm Yu-4 torpedo, a locally produced passive homing 40-knot (74 km/h) torpedo based on the SAET-50 and roughly comparable to the SAET-60. Surface targets may be attacked at up to 15 km. Yu-6 wire-guided torpedoes may also be used for targeting submarines. It is also likely that the Type 039 is capable of carrying the YJ-8 anti-ship missile, a cruise missile which can be launched from the same tube as the boat's torpedoes, and can target surface vessels at up to 80 km. The missile is subsonic and carries a 165 kg warhead. For mining operations, in place of torpedoes, the submarine can carry 24 to 36 naval mines, deliverable through the torpedo tubes. The general designer of the torpedo and missile launching system is Mr. Sun Zhuguo (\u5b59\u67f1\u56fd, 1937-), and the launching system is compatible with AShM, ASW, torpedoes of both China and Russian/Soviet origin.\n\nAlthough Type 039 has successfully test fired the CY-1 ASW Missile under water like the Yuan-class submarine, the status of the missile is in question because nothing is heard about it entering mass production. The CY-1 ASW missile has a maximum range of 18 km (10 nm), and when using A244 or Mark 46 torpedo as a payload.\n\nSensors:\nThe main sensor is the medium-frequency sonar mounted in the bow of the submarine, with passive and active modes, which is used for both search and attack. In addition, the system offers a method of underwater communications, and also functions as a torpedo approach warning system. This sonar is the Chinese development of French Thomson-CSF TSM-2233 sonar, and is capable of simultaneously tracking 4 to 12 targets depending on the function it is used for. To enhance passive search capabilities, a low frequency sonar of French Thomson-CSF TSM-2255 design is mounted on the flanks of the hull, with a maximum range in excess of 30 km and capable of simultaneously tracking four targets. The system is further enhanced with the integration of a domestic Chinese passive ranging sonar on board, designated as H/SQG-04 sonar. For surface search, a small I-band radar is fitted.\n\nThis class is the first Chinese submarine to be fitted with an integrated electronic support measures / radio direction finder / radar warning receiver system designated as SRW209 Submarine Radar Reconnaissance Equipment, which works at S - Ku bands with 100% detection rate. The SRW209 is fully automatic and can be either operated by a single operator with a console with a color CRT (which can be replaced by LCD) display console, or linked to the combat data system, which is capable of tracking multiple targets.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1998, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China", "North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)"], "dis": {"name": "SSG SONG TYPE 039 CLASS", "string": "01.04.045.005.002.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 039 Class;

The Chinese variant is known as the Type 033 Romeo. A total of 84 Type 033 submarines were built in China from 1962 to 1984, plus several exported to other countries.\n\nThe Chinese Type 033 incorporated some improvements over the original Romeo, including noise reduction of 20 dB. Sonar on board was also continuously upgraded: the original Soviet sonar was first replaced by domestic Chinese Type 105 sonar, which consequently was replaced by H/SQ2-262A sonar built by No. 613 Factory. Today most of the Type 033 subs have been retired or preserved, with a few remaining in service for training purposes. A total of six Chinese Romeo class submarine variants were developed:\n\nType 6633: Original Chinese built Romeo, China was to have assembled these Romeos from knock-down kits provided by the Soviet Union, 6 were planned, but only 2 were completed. The construction program came to a complete stop when the USSR stopped delivery of parts following the Sino-Soviet split. Construction of the 3rd unit at Wuhan was stopped, and available parts were diverted to complete the first pair, but many parts had to be developed indigenously. The primary improvement of Type 6633 over the original Soviet boats is the use of domestic Chinese batteries, which had slightly superior performance to that of the original Soviet batteries.\n\nType 033: Complete domestic production in China was achieved in 1967, and subsequently the project was renamed the Type 033. However, experience from deployment of completed boats in warmer climates proved that the original Soviet refrigeration and air conditioning system designed for subarctic and arctic area was woefully inadequate for subtropical and tropical regions, so redesigns were needed to improve refrigeration and air conditioning systems, and all boats to be stationed in tropical and subtropical regions went through such a refit. In September 1969 construction of new Type 033s, with improved air conditioning and refrigeration capability, began at Huangpu Shipyard in Guangzhou, eventually, 13 units were completed.\n\nES5A: Upgraded Type 033, with improvements mainly involving the replacement of equipment of Soviet origin with domestic Chinese systems, which includes: QZHA\u201510 (Type 779) attack periscope and QDYA\u201510 (Type 778) general purpose periscope. Addition of H/SQG-2 ranging sonar, Type 063 communication systems, and countermeasure systems. Domestic Chinese Type 801 sonar replaced the original Soviet MARS-24 sonar. The only difference between the Type 801 sonar and the MARS-24 sonar is that there are 24 transducer elements for the Type 801 as opposed to 12 in the original MARS 24, so the Chinese sonar had better accuracy.

The Chinese variant is known as the Type 033 Romeo. A total of 84 Type 033 submarines were built in China from 1962 to 1984, plus several exported to other countries.\n\nThe Chinese Type 033 incorporated some improvements over the original Romeo, including noise reduction of 20 dB. Sonar on board was also continuously upgraded: the original Soviet sonar was first replaced by domestic Chinese Type 105 sonar, which consequently was replaced by H/SQ2-262A sonar built by No. 613 Factory. Today most of the Type 033 subs have been retired or preserved, with a few remaining in service for training purposes. A total of six Chinese Romeo class submarine variants were developed:\n\nType 6633: Original Chinese built Romeo, China was to have assembled these Romeos from knock-down kits provided by the Soviet Union, 6 were planned, but only 2 were completed.

It incorporated several features that resulted in the type becoming one of most produced and commercially successful hovercraft designs in the world.\n\nWhile the SR.N2 and SR.N5s operated in commercial service as trials craft, the SR.N6 has the distinction of being the first production hovercraft to enter commercial service. In comparison to the SR.N5, the SR.N6 was stretched in length, providing more than double the seating capacity. Some models of the craft were stretched further, enabling an even greater capacity.\n\nExperience gained in the development of the SR.N6 has been attributed as heavily contributing towards the design and production of the largest civil hovercraft to be ever produced, the SR.N4. Several major design features of the SR.N6 appeared on both the SR.N4 and further hovercraft designs by Saunders-Roe and its successor, the British Hovercraft Corporation.\n\nThe Saunders-Roe SR.N6 (also known as the Winchester class) is a medium-sized hovercraft primarily designed for passenger service. The initial models of the type were capable of accommodating up to 38 passengers, which was greater than the maximum capacity of 18 that could be carried by the smaller SR.N5. The SR.N6 was subsequently further stretched to accommodate a further 20 passengers; this capacity upgrade let to it being considered to be more viable for commercial operations than any previous hovercraft design. By eventually increasing the capacity to 58 seats, the SR.N6 Mk.1S became the first hovercraft to be capable of transporting a typical coach load of people. In a military configuration, the SR.N6 is capable of carrying up to 55 fully equipped troops, or alternatively up to 6 tons of equipment.\n\nThe SR.N6 was powered by a single marinised model of the Bristol Gnome turboshaft engine; this drove both a single rear-facing 9 ft (2.74 m) diameter 4-bladed Dowty Rotol variable-pitch propeller along with a 7 ft (2.13 m) diameter centrifugal lift fan. The Gnome engine was an expensive component for operators, leading to some establishing their own internal overhaul facilities and making arrangements with other Gnome operators, including the Royal Navy, to reduce costs from relying on costly services from Rolls-Royce Limited.[9] Around 20 per cent of the operating costs of the type have been attributed to maintenance of the 4 ft flexible skirt, which reportedly lasted for up to 500 hours, while similar cost levels have been reported for fuel.\n\nEarly on, the SR.N6 was outfitted with an improved skirt, featuring fingers and forward puff ports, which resulted in improved forward control and reduced skirt wear; fingers had not been present upon the initial version of the skirt used prior to 1966. The endurance of the fingers would be progressively improved over time, issues with salt spray negatively affecting both the engine and propeller were also encountered early on. An initial experience of some components having short overhaul lifespans or being unreliable was encountered during early days. During the early years of not only the SR.N6 but other hovercraft as well, the hovercraft skirt remained an unresolved area of difficulty during this era.\n\nThe SR.N6 was piloted from a forward-seated position at the front of the main passenger cabin. The pilot would exercise control over the direction of the craft via a series of control surfaces that was located immediately behind the variable pitch propeller. Early on, pilots were normally aviators which had been recruited from the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm, however it has been claimed that experienced mariners would often be more skilled at operating the type, if not taking more time to adapt to its atypical form of propulsion, in part due to their familiarity at safely navigating within uncontrolled maritime environments. For navigation purposes, some SR.N6s were outfitted with onboard radar; multiple radar arrangements were used with the type, including pilots receiving radio guidance from on-shore radar operators in some circumstances.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1964, "countryOfOrigin": "United Kingdom", "proliferation": "Egypt, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Italy, Saudi Arabia", "selectedregions": ["All Regions"], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Egypt", "Iran (Islamic Republic of)", "Iraq", "Italy", "Saudi Arabia"], "dis": {"name": "Unknown", "string": "00.00.000.000.000.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "SR.

Trials between December 1972 to January 1977 has revealed that the performance was somewhat satisfactory, but the speed was slow and the ability to operate in bad weather condition is poor, with the maximum sea state allowed to operate being sea state 6.

Like its predecessor Type 79I LSM, Type 79II LSM was also designed by 708th Research Institute. The main difference between 79I & 79II is that the latter is larger, with dimensions increased to 72 m x 13.8 m x 2.6 m respectively, and the displacement is increased to 1100 tons. More complex machinery was added, lead to the increase of crew member to 109, more than 3 times of that of the original Type 79I LSM. The speed is also slightly increased to 13 kts. Armament is strengthened by the addition of two BM21 122 mm rocket launchers.

In addition to performing oceanographic research duties, the most important mission of Xiangyanghong 5 is acting as a command ship for Chinese intercontinental ballistic missile trials in 1980.\n\nOriginally build as a Francesco Nullo class cargo ship by Paris Commune Shipyard in Poland, the predecessor of current day Stocznia Gdynia, the ship was launched in 1966 and purchased by the Guangzhou Ocean Shipping Co. Ltd. (\u5e7f\u5dde\u8fdc\u6d0b\u516c\u53f8) subsidiary of COSCO and named as Changning (\u957f\u5b81). In 1970, it was decided to convert a cargo ship to oceanographic research ship in support of Project 718, the Chinese project of developing its own intercontinental ballistic missile. The design for conversion work was completed by China Ship and Maritime Engineering Design and Research Academy (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8239\u8236\u53ca\u6d77\u6d0b\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u9662). also more commonly known as the 708th Institute of CSSC. Work begun on June 1, 1970 at Guangzhou Shipyard International and was completed on December 20, 1972, costing \u00a5 2,500,000. Changes included increasing ballast and fresh water storage, and equipment needed for scientific research, such as communication gears including fax machine. Various research labs were added and navigational system was upgraded. Because Changning was a cargo ship with only minimal crew, large personnel quarters were added to house hugely increased crew due to researchers assigned on board. Upon completion, the ship was renamed as Xiangyanghong 5 and was immediately put in use.\n\nHowever, due to the political turmoil in China, namely, Cultural Revolution, each mission were relatively short and close to Chinese coast, because Chinese economy at the time could not provide sufficient support for prolonged missions further away from Chinese coastline. Prolonged mission finally became a reality after end of the Cultural Revolution, and majority of them were concentrated in 1977 and 1978, with the four longest missions spreading out between the two years. Experience gained from mission deployment mandated another major upgrade of the ship which begun in December 1978, with over 860 upgrades and modifications total. Guangzhou Shipyard International was once again selected as the primary contractor and work was completed on December 17, 1979. After this major upgrade, Xiangyanghong 5 was assigned to participate in Task 580, the transfer of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missile.

The U-209PN ordered by the Portuguese Navy is actually a Type 214. The first three Dolphin class submarines built for the Israeli Navy are based on the Type 209 although heavily modified and enlarged.\n\nSeveral modifications have occurred in the class resulting in these variants including the fitting of newer diesel engines. New air conditioning and electronics features have been added to accommodate orders from South America. The displacement in some variants has increased by nearly 50% in order to install new equipment, modernize accommodations, and extend range.\n\nThe team of Ingenieur Kontor L\u00fcbeck (IKL) and Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) proposed an enlarged Type 209 submarine, the Type 2000, for the Collins class submarine program. The proposed design was roughly 500 tons more than the Type 209/1500s for India and lost to the Type 471 from Kockums, an enlarged V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland class submarine.\n\nThe Thomson class built for the Chilean Navy has escape hatches fitted in the torpedo and engine room. An additional aft hatch is fitted in the sail with access to the machinery. The boats are fitted with higher masts to compensate for regional ocean wave conditions.\n\nThe Tikuna class built by the Brazilian navy is a modified Type 209/1400. The boat is 0.85 m longer and fitted with higher power diesels, different electric motors, batteries, electronics and sensors.\n\nThe Shishumar class built for and by India is unique for having an IKL-designed integrated escape sphere. The sphere has accommodations for the entire crew with an eight-hour air supply.\n\nThe Sabalo class built for Venezuela was slightly lengthened during a modernization at HDW in the early 1990s. The increased length is due to the addition of a new sonar dome that is similar to the model found on the German Type 206.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2006, the Indonesian Type 209/1300 submarine Cakra underwent a refurbishment by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in South Korea. The refurbished submarine featured new batteries, overhauled engines, and modernized combat system. Both submarines' existing STN Atlas-Elektronik CSU 3-2 sonar suite were replaced with L-3 ELAC Nautik's LOPAS 8300 passive sonar system and Kongsberg MSI-90U MK2 CMS. In 2009, Daewoo won another order to refurbish Nanggala, which was completed in early 2012.\n\nIt is also possible to upgrade these submarines with the latest Air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems. The first ships to receive this upgrade were to be three ships of the Greek Poseidon class Type 209/1200 under the Neptune II upgrade program. They were to be upgraded by cutting the boat in half aft of the control room and adding a 6 m plug with a 120 kW Siemens AIP system to the ship. The program was canceled in 2009 due to cancellation of the Archimedes Project (Type 214), but not before Okeanos (S118) completed the upgrade. After the Archimedes Project settlement was reached, it was decided that instead of upgrading the remaining two Type 209s, two additional Type 214 ships were to be ordered, but that deal was cancelled by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft. Turkish Navy's AIP upgrade of At\u0131lay-class (209 Type 1200) was also shelved in favor of acquiring new Type 214 subs."}, {"name": "Note #2", "notes": "Total Built: 61"}], "type": "WEG", "version": 1}, "images": [{"name": "Type_209_submarine(C).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/b/bb/Type_209_submarine%28C%29.jpg"}, {"name": "Type_209_submarine(A).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/b/b3/Type_209_submarine%28A%29.jpg"}, {"name": "Type_209_submarine(B).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/e/ee/Type_209_submarine%28B%29.jpg"}], "categories": ["WEG", "Naval Watercraft", "Submarines", "Diesel-Electric Patrol and Attack Submarines", "Germany", "PRO_Argentina", "Sea", "Tier3"]}, {"title": "Gwanggaeto the Great Class (KDX-I Class) South Korean Destroyer", "id": 12242, "json": {"tiers": [false, true, false, false], "notes": "The Gwanggaeto the Great-class destroyers, often called KDX-I, are destroyers, but are classified by some as frigates, operated by the Republic of Korea Navy.

SSGN Oscar II class cruise-missile submarines (Project 949A/Antey class) are designed primarily to attack NATO aircraft carriers, battle groups. To cope with its resource problems, the Russian Navy, in the early 1990s, made an effort at preserving its core submarine force capabilities.\n\nThe Russian Navy continued to invest in new construction. In the late 1990s, it completed several new submarines of the third generation Oscar II. 11 of the larger Oscar II submarines were built between 1985 and 1999 at the Sevmash yard in Severodvinsk. Three have been decommissioned and one, the Kursk, sank. Two Oscar II submarines are active with the Northern Fleet and five with the Pacific Fleet.\n\nThe Pacific Fleet is set to upgrade four Oscar II submarines with 3M-54 Kalibr family of cruise missiles by 2021 as part of a multi-year program. The submarines can also be fitted with other cruise missiles, including 3M-54 anti-ship, 3M-14 land-attack missiles, and PT91 anti-submarine warfare (ASW) torpedoes.\n\nThe upgraded submarines will be designated Project 949AM.\n\nEleven Project 949A Antey submarines were completed at Severodvinsk, of which five were assigned to the Soviet Northern Fleet. At one stage it had been planned to develop a new fourth-generation follow-on to Project 949A, but this plan was later dropped. The external differences between the two classes were that the 949A class is about 10 meters (33 ft) longer than its predecessor (approximately 154 meters, 505 ft rather than 143 m, 469 ft), providing space and buoyancy for improved electronics and quieter propulsion.\n\nSome sources speculate that the acoustic performance of the Oscar II class is superior to the early Akula class but inferior to the Akula II class as well as subsequent (4th generation) designs. It also has a larger fin, and its propellers have seven blades instead of four.\n\nLike all post-World War II Soviet designs, they are of double hull construction. Similarly, like other Soviet submarine designs, Project 949 not only has a bridge open to the elements on top of the sail but, for use in inclement weather, there is an enclosed bridge forward and slightly below this station. A distinguishing mark is a slight bulge at the top of the fin. A large door on either side of the fin reaches this bulge. These are wider at the top than on the bottom and are hinged on the bottom.

A total of three ships were built between 2000 and 2010, and all three were in commission by 2012.\n\nThe Shivalik class, along with the seven Project 17A frigates currently being developed from them, are projected be the principal frigates of the Indian Navy in the first half of the 21st century. All ships of the class were built by Mazagon Dock Limited. The class and the lead vessel have been named for the Shivalik hills. Subsequent vessels in the class are also named for hill-ranges in India.\n\nProject 17 was conceived in the 1990s to meet the Indian Navy's need for a class of stealthy frigates that were to be designed and built in India. The Directorate of Naval Design (DND)'s specifications for the project called for a class of \"5000 ton stealth frigates (Project 17) incorporating advanced signature suppression and signature management features\". The first three units were formally ordered by the Indian Navy in early 1999.\n\nShivalik's design embodies many firsts in Indian ships. Shivalik is the first Indian naval vessel to use a combined diesel or gas (CODOG) propulsion system. The CODOG gearboxes were designed and built by Elecon Engineering.\n\n\nAn officer's cabin on the INS Shivalik\nThe main features of the class are its stealth characteristics and land-attack capability. The ships incorporate structural, thermal and acoustic stealth features. The vessels use 10 gigabit LAN for their network.\n\nThere has also been an increased emphasis on crew comfort in this class of ships with more spacious accommodation being provided. Also, INS Shivalik is the first ship in the Indian Navy with chapati- and dosa-makers on board.\n\nThe Shivalik-class frigates have a length of 142.5 m (468 ft) overall, a beam of 16.9 m (55 ft) and a draft of 4.5 m (15 ft). The ships displace about 4,900 tonnes (4,800 long tons; 5,400 short tons) at normal load and 6,200 tonnes (6,100 long tons; 6,800 short tons) at full load.

special-purpose diesel-electric submarine that uses a nuclear reactor as a supplementary power generator. The existence of the submarine was first revealed in 2007 when details about the boat were accidentally published on the Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region's local government website as part of an account of a meeting with its commander. It serves in the Russian Navy's Northern Fleet and is being used as a technology demonstrator for testing upgraded weapons and military equipment or as an intelligence collection boat.\n\nSarov was designed by the Rubin Design Bureau during the 1980s and its construction began in 1989 at the Krasnoye Sormovo Shipyard, Nizhniy Novgorod. In 1998, work on the submarine was stopped due to the funding problems that came up with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, after revision of the project, work reportedly continued at the Sevmash Shipyard, Severodvinsk since 2003. Sarov was launched in 2007 and commissioned into service with the Russian Navy in 2008. It is named after the city of Sarov.\n\nBased on the Kilo-class submarine, it is a unique platform due to the combination of its diesel-electric power system and a small nuclear reactor. It is believed the reactor does not drive the propeller itself, but rather produces electricity to recharge the conventional battery system, greatly extending the underwater endurance of the submarine. It has been noted that since electric propulsion is inherently very quiet, but tends to lack range, possession of a long-range electrical system would make Sarov an excellent intelligence-gathering platform. The Russian Defence Ministry has not revealed whether the boat is employed in this role.\n\nSarov has a crew of 52 and can stay submerged for up to 20 days. It has a maximum speed of 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph) on the surface, while 17 knots (31 km/h; 20 mph) when submerged and can operate up to 300 meters (980 ft) depth. Due to the addition of a nuclear reactor section behind the submarine's sail and an escape capsule in the sail, Sarov is significantly longer (98 m) compared to the length of the original Kilo-class submarines (72 m).", "dateOfIntroduction": 2008, "countryOfOrigin": "Russia (RUS)", "proliferation": "Russian Federation", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Russian Federation"], "dis": {"name": "SSA SAROV PROJECT 20120 CLASS", "string": "01.04.222.007.022.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "B-90 Sarov Class; Sarov Class; Project 20120 Sargan Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Intelligence Collection Submarine"}, {"name": "Proliferation", "value": "1 built"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Krasnoye Sormovo Shipyard\nSevmash Shipyard"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "2008-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "52 (25 Off. + 27 Enl.)"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "98 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "9.9 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "7 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Surfaced", "value": "2,300 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Submerged", "value": "3,950 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "1 xKristall-27 electrochemical generator"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "Electric Diesel"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed, Surface", "value": "10 kts (19 kmh)"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed, Submerged", "value": "17 kts (31 kmh)"}, {"name": "Maximum Depth", "value": "300 m"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "45 days"}]}, {"name": "Torpedo Weapon System", "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Torpedo Tubes", "value": "2 x 650-mm torpedo tubes and/or specialized torpedo tube for Status-6 Weapon."}, {"name": "Torpedo Name", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Torpedo Basic Load", "value": "INA"}]}]}, {"name": "Fire Control", "properties": [{"name": "Note", "value": "INA"}]}, {"name": "Protection", "properties": [{"name": "Active Protection System", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "NBC Protection", "value": "INA"}]}], "variants": [{"name": "SAROV", "notes": "Commissioned: 2008\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}], "type": "WEG", "version": 1}, "images": [{"name": "Sarov_Class_Suybmarine_(DD).png", "url": "/mediawiki/images/7/7a/Sarov_Class_Suybmarine_%28DD%29.png"}, {"name": "Sarov_Class_Suybmarine_(CC).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/1/15/Sarov_Class_Suybmarine_%28CC%29.jpg"}, {"name": "Sarov_Class_Suybmarine_(DD).png", "url": "/mediawiki/images/7/7a/Sarov_Class_Suybmarine_%28DD%29.png"}], "categories": ["WEG", "Naval Watercraft", "Intelligence Collection Ships", "Russia (RUS)", "PRO_Russian Federation", "Sea", "Tier2"]}, {"title": "Santa Cruz Class (TR-1700 Class) Argentinian Diesel-Electric Patrol Submarine", "id": 7439, "json": {"tiers": [false, false, true, false], "notes": "The TR-1700 (Santa Cruz) is a class of diesel-electric patrol submarines built by Thyssen Nordseewerke for the Argentine Navy in the 1980s, with two submarines completed. These ships are amongst the largest submarines built in Germany since World War II and are among the fastest diesel-electric submarines in the world. ARA San Juan was lost on 17 November 2017, leaving ARA Santa Cruz as the only remaining submarine of this class.\n\nThe original 1977 plan called for six boats, two TR-1700s built in Germany by Thyssen Nordseewerke, two in Argentina by Astillero Domecq Garcia, and two smaller TR-1400s also built in Argentina. The final agreement in 1982 was modified to six TR-1700s, with the last four to be built in Argentina. The TR-1700s to be built in Argentina were considered for an upgrade to a nuclear submarine using INVAP's CAREM reactor, which began development at that time. The nuclear submarine project never came to fruition, despite later attempts to revive it.\n\nThe submarine was designed by Thyssen and its features include high underwater speed, endurance (for a diesel submarine), and survivability. The boat's four MTU diesel engines, four generators, and Siemens electric motor can propel it at speeds up to 25 knots (46 km/h; 29 mph). Eight 120-cell batteries are installed on each boat. They have a diving depth of 300 m (980 ft). Normal endurance of these boats is 30 days with an extended range up to 70 days. These boats are equipped to accept a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV). Armaments include six bow 533 mm (21 in) torpedo tubes and 22 SST (Special Surface Target) or Mark 37 torpedo. The automatic torpedo reload system can reload the tubes in 50 seconds.\n\nThyssen proposed the TR1700A for the Australian Collins-class submarine program. The proposed design had a reworked pressure hull, was six meters longer, and half a meter wider than the TR-1700s built for Argentina. It lost to the Type 471 from Kockums, an enlarged V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland-class submarine.\n\nThe first two submarines were delivered on schedule in 1984\u201385. The remaining four built in Argentina were suspended due to the Argentinean economic crisis of the 1980s. In 1996 work completely ceased on ARA Santa Fe at 70% (or 52%) completion while ARA Santiago del Estero was only 30% complete. After attempts to complete and sell the boats to Taiwan failed, they were cannibalized, along with the parts for the fifth and sixth units, to support the continued operations of the first two submarines.\n\nSanta Cruz received its mid-life modernization at Arsenal de Marinha, Rio de Janeiro Brazil between September 1999 and 2001. The work involved the replacement of the engines, batteries, and sonar. Her sister boat San Juan entered the Astillero Domecq Garcia shipyard to receive her refit in 2007; she completed refit in 2013.\n\nIn September 2010, it was revealed that the Ministry of Defense was conducting feasibility studies to decide if ARA Santa Fe (S-43) should be completed. The decision should be made sometime after completing the mid-life modernization of ARA San Juan (S-42). The estimated cost of completing Santa Fe was $60 million.\n\nOn 17 November 2017, the ARA San Juan was reported missing; reports of a fire at the time were denied by the Argentine Navy. A year after that, on 17 November 2018, private company Ocean Infinity (appointed by the Argentine Government) announced that they successfully located the wreck, at 900 metres depth and 500 km from Comodoro Rivadavia.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1984, "countryOfOrigin": "Argentina", "proliferation": "Argentina", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Argentina"], "dis": {"name": "SS SANTA CRUZ CLASS", "string": "01.04.010.005.001.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Santa Cruz Class; TR-1700-class"}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "4 Submarines Built"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Diesel-Electric Patrol Submarine"}, {"name": "Builders", "value": "Thyssen Nordseewerke, Emden, Germany"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "1984-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "30 (5 off. + 25 enl.)"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "65.93 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "7.30 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "6.50 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Standard", "value": "1,770 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Surface", "value": "2,116 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Submerged", "value": "2,264 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "4 x MTU 16V652 MB80 diesel driving 4 alternators driving 2 Siemens HR4525 motors"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "Diesel-Electric"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "8,980 total bhp"}, {"name": "Shaft", "value": "1"}, {"name": "Speed, Surface", "value": "11 knots"}, {"name": "Speed, Snorkeling", "value": "12 knots"}, {"name": "Speed, Submerged", "value": "21 knots"}, {"name": "Range, Submerged", "value": "400 nm at 4 knots"}, {"name": "Range, Surface", "value": "12,000 nm at 8 knots"}, {"name": "Range Snorkeling", "value": "6,000 nm at 8 knots"}, {"name": "Operational Depth", "value": "270 m"}, {"name": "Maximum Depth", "value": "300 m"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "30 days"}]}, {"name": "Main Armament", "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "533mm Torpedo Tubes"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "6 x 533mm Torpedo Tubes"}]}, {"name": "Torpedos", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "Mk 48"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Heavy Torpedo"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "533", "units": "mm"}, {"name": "Variants", "value": "Ex-10 RETORC (Research Torpedo Configuration);\nMk 48 Mod 0/2;\nMk 48 Mod 1;\nMk 48 Mod 3;\nMk 48 Mod 4;\nMk 48 Mod 5;\nMk 48 Mod 6;\nMk 48 Mod6AT;\n\"Full-up\" ADCAP;\nClosed-Cycle Advanced Capability Propulsion System (CCACPS);\nMk 48 Mod 7 ADCAP CBASS\nHalf-Length Mk 48"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "22"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "5.84 m"}, {"name": "Diameter", "value": "533 mm"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "1,565 kg"}, {"name": "Warhead Weight", "value": "295 kg"}, {"name": "Warhead Type", "value": "conventional high-explosive (PBXN-3)"}, {"name": "Propulsion", "value": "500-hp axial-flow, gas-piston (swashplate) pump-jet using Otto II mono-propellant (nitrogen ester and Hydroxylamine Perchlorate/HAP oxidant) liquid fuel"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "55 kts (102 kmh)"}, {"name": "Maximum Range at 55 knots", "value": "20 nm (23 mi, 37 km)"}, {"name": "Maximum Range at 40 knots", "value": "27 nm (31 mi, 50 km)"}, {"name": "Maximum Depth", "value": "760 m"}, {"name": "Guidance System", "value": "may be launched as free-running or wire-guided free-running; homing is by either active or passive acoustic means.

Type 094 succeeds the Type 092 submarine.\n\nThe Type 094 was first spotted in 2006 on commercial satellite imagery of the Xiaopingdao Submarine Base. It was noted as being longer than Type 092. Two Type 094s were spotted at the Bohai Shipyard in May 2007, although it was not clear if these included the one spotted in 2006.\n\nOne was operational in 2010, three in 2013, and four in 2015. As many as eight may enter service by 2020.\n\nThe PRC is interested in augmenting its ICBM forces with SSBNs to enhance its comprehensive nuclear deterrent force. Nuclear deterrent patrols commenced in December 2015.\n\nType 094 is armed with 12 JL-2 SLBMs, each with an estimated range of 7,400 km (4,600 mi). Each missile carries one warhead. The Type 094 and JL-2 are China's first credible sea-based nuclear deterrent.\n\nGlobalsecurity.org notes that a Type 094 patrolling just northeast of the Kuril Islands would be able to strike three-quarters of the contiguous United States; whereas launching from Chinese coastal waters would barely reach the Aleutian Islands. Thomas-Noone and Medcalf note that the Type 094's noisiness would make it difficult for it to reach and maintain patrol areas where it could strike at the contiguous United States; no such limitations would exist against Indian targets.\n\nType 094 (Western reporting name Jin-class) is a Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine (SSBN). It is the second-generation SSBN of the Chinese navy. Development possibly began in the early 1980s. It is a successor to the unreliable sole Type 092 or Xia class boat, which was a catalog of disasters and had little strategic value. The whole development project of the Type 094 class is kept in secrecy.\n\n   Speculations have been made, that development of the Type 094 class was assisted by Russian Rubin Design Bureau, however, this information was not confirmed. Construction of the lead vessel began in 1999 and it was launched in 2004. It seems that the first boat was commissioned in 2010. The second boat of the class was launched in 2007. Some sources claim that these Chinese ballistic missile submarines were plagued with various problems and design flaws. As of 2018 China operates 4 of these ballistic missile submarines. This fact was also confirmed by a US Department of Defense report. It is believed that at least one of these boats was completed to an improved project, which is sometimes referred to as Type 094A. These boats are deployed on the Longpo naval base on Hainan island. These ballistic missile boats form China's sea-based nuclear deterrent capability.\n\n   By 2018 Jin-class boats were never sent on long-range deterrent patrol missions, possibly due to various problems and design flaws. Instead, these boats are patrolling in the South China Sea, relatively close to China's coastal waters.

The large smooth and angled surfaces, a common feature among the new generaton of European FFGs such as French La Fayette class, represent a considerable innovation for China.\n\nThe PLA Navy received two Type 052B (NATO codename: Luyang class) multirole missile destroyer in 2004. These ships, built by Shanghai-based Jiangnan Shipyard, featured enhanced air defence and antisubmarine warfare capabilities using a mixture of Russian-made and Chinese indigenous systems. Building of the first-of-class ship, 168 Guangzhou, began in 2000. The ship was launched on 23 May 2002, and had been stationed at Jiangnan Shipyard sine then for weapon and radar system installations. The sea trial began in May 2003, and the ship officially entered service with the PLA Navy on 15 July 2004. The second hull 169 Wuhan was launched in January 2003 and commissioned in late 2004.\n\nUnlike the previous Chinese-built surface combatants, which were mainly equipped with European and indigenous weapon and radar systems, the Type 052B was the first to have adopted Russian technologies including the 9M317 Shtil (NATO codename: SA-N-12 Grizzly) air defence missile and its associated Front Dome fire-control radar, and the Top Plate 3D air search radar. The ship also used two Ukraine-made DA80/DN80 gas turbines as its primary propulsion. Newly developed indigenous technologies onboard the Type 052B included the 100mm single-barrel compact main gun and the Type 730 seven-barrelled close-in defence system (CIWS).\n\nThe Type 052B is thought to be comparable to the Russian Project 956E Sovremenny class destroyer in terms of general performance and capability. This project has set a perfect example of integrating the indigenous platform with foreign-made systems to fill the gap before similar indigenous systems become available, thus reducing the amount of time required in the whole project.\n\nThe acquiring of the two Type 052B destroyers further increased the PLA Navy\u2019s capability to combat in deep ocean. It also demonstrates China\u2019s rapid progress in building a \u2018blue water\u2019 navy that is capable of operating far away from its homeports, a capability that the Chinese navy has been seeking for nearly two decades.\n\nThe displacement of the ship is estimated to be 6,500 tonnes. The ship\u2019s hull design incorporates strong radar signature reduction features such as the sloped sides and reduced external features. The hull surface is coated in radar-absorbent paint. The funnel also has cooling devices to reduce the ship\u2019s infrared feature. The ships has a stern flight deck and a helicopter hanger to accommodate one Ka-28 ASW helicopter.\n\nThe Type 052B destroyer is armed with two Russian-made surface-to-air missile launchers, one on the front deck behind the 100mm main gun, and one on top of the helicopter hanger. The launchers can fire the latest 9M317 Shtil (NATO codename: SA-N-12 Grizzly) semi-active, radar-homing, medium-range air defence missile. The missile uses the ship\u2019s Russian-made Fregat M2EM Top Plate 3D circular scan radar for target acquisition, and the Front Dome (two radar for each launcher, each radar with two guidance channels) indication radar for missile guidance. Up to three missiles can be aimed simultaneously. The range is up to 38km against aircraft and 20km against anti-ship cruise missile. The ship carries 48 missiles.\n\nFour 4-cell launcher for the YJ-83 (C-803) sea-skimming, radar-homing anti-ship cruise missile system are installed behind the funnel. The YJ-83 is said to have a final approach speed of Mach 1.5 and a maximum range of 150km. It was noted that the YJ-83 onboard the Type 052B relies on a Russian-made Band Stand fire-control radar to provide target information, which would enable the YJ-83 to reach its maximum range of fire without relaying target information by the shipborne helicopter.\n\nThe Type 052B destroyer was the first PLA Navy warship to be fitted with the CIWS. There is a seven-barrel 30mm Type 730 CIWS installed on each side of the bridge. The weapon system has a maximum rate of fire of 4,600~5,800 rounds/min.\n\nThe ship also has a single-barrel 100mm gun developed by 713 Institute on the basis of the French Creusot-Loire T100C design. The gun can be used against surface targets and air targets such as aircraft and low speed missile, with a maximum rate of fire of 90 rounds/min. The gun can be operated in fully automatic mode from the radar control system, from the shipborne optical sighting system, or laid manually. The turret design incorporates strong radar cross-section reduction features.\n\nThe Type 052B destroyer is fitted with two triple 324mm Yu-7 (Mk-46 Mod 1) antisubmarine torpedo tubes and two Type 75 twelve-barrel 240mm antisubmarine rocket launchers. Range is up to 1,200m. The rocket is armed with a 34kg warhead. Additionally, the destroyer has four 18-barrel multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) installed on the front deck. The purpose of these MRLs remains unknown but is thought to be used to launch antisubmarine rockets, ground- attack rockets and/or decoys/chaffs.\n\nThe air search radar is a Russian Fregat M2EM (NATO codename: Top Plate) 3D air search radar operating at D/E band. The radar has a maximum detect range of 230km to aircraft and 50km to sea-skimming missile. There are four (in contrast to six on Sovremenny class) Russian Front Dome fire control radar (F band) for the 9M38 air defence missile. The main gun and anti-ship missile are controlled by the Russian Band Stand radar. The ZJK-5 combat system onboard the Type 052B is thought to be an improved variant of the Type 051B (Luhai class)\u2019s ZJK-4-3A. The ZJK-5 is based on the 1553B military data bus and the 100Mbps Ethernet technology. The multi-channel defence suite is capable of engaging several targets simultaneously.\n\nThe destroyer\u2019s stern hanger accommodates one Kamov Ka-28 (NATO codename: Helix) antisubmarine warfare (ASW) helicopter. Carrying various weapons including torpedoes and deep charges, the helicopter can operate in all weather conditions up to 200km from the host ship. Alternatively, the destroyer can carry an indigenous Z-9C helicopter.\n\nThe Type 052B\u2019s propulsion is in the form of CODOG, consisting of two Ukraine-made DA80/DN80 gas turbines rated at 48,600hp and two Shaanxi diesels (Chinese copy of the MTU 20V956TB92) rated at 8,840hp (6.5 MW).\n\nThe unit [hull number 168, initially thought to possibly be named Yantai, but actually named Guangzhou], started building in 1999, with initially completion expected in 2001. By mid-2002 it appeared that this unit was fitting out, and was evidently constructed along modified lines to reduce radar signature.\n\nInitially it was expected that the second unit of this class would enter service in 2000, with two more following with commissioning dates in 2002 and 2003. Since 1999, only two hulls had been constructed at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, with the first ship [168] launched on 25 May 2002. The second ship [169] was launched in October 2002.\n\nBy April 2003 it became apparent that the ships would carry new Russian weapons -- the effective SA-N-12 anti-aircraft missile plus a long-range Russian search radar, and another radar similar to the Russian BAND STAND over-the-horizon targeting radar. The latter indicated that a new, long range anti-ship missile will be carried. These ships are basically comparable to Taiwan's new U.S. KIDD class destroyers in size and capability, but much more stealthy.\n\nIn June 2005 it was reported that two Luyang I destroyers were operational or undergoing sea trials.\n\nThe destroyer \"Guangzhou\" (Hull Number 168) of the PLA Navy set sail for the sea waters off Pakistan on 21 February 2009 from Sanya City of Hainan Province to participate in the \"Peace 09\" multinational maritime military exercise. The multinational maritime military exercise was initiated by the Pakistani Navy. Navies from 11 countries, including China, the US, the UK, France, Japan and Turkey, sent their ships, aircraft and Marine Corps elements to participate in the exercise. And military observers from 20-odd countries, including Russia, Germany, Australia, Egypt and Indonesia viewed the exercise. The Chinese Navy sent a task force composed of the destroyer \"Guangzhou\" from the South China Sea Fleet (SCSF), a helicopter and 10 members of the Marine Corps to participate in this \"Peace 09\" exercise.\n\nMilitary officials and soldiers of Chinese navy's missile destroyer DDG-168 Guangzhou attended a sail setting ceremony in Sanya, south China's Hainan Province, on March 4, 2010. A new Chinese naval task force set sail on Thursday morning from a military port in the south Hainan Island to replace the fourth batch of flotilla in the Gulf of Aden escorting merchant vessels.\n\nChinese navy's missile destroyer DDG-168 Guangzhou arrived in Guangzhou in south China's Guangdong province, December 26, 2012 and took part in an activity marking the 4th anniversary of the start of China's escorting missions in the Gulf of Aden. The ship was open to the public during its stay in the city.\n\nChina's Defense Ministry defended a regular training and sailing mission by Chinese ships in the East China Sea. The statement on 26 October 2012 was in response to Japanese reports that three Chinese maritime surveillance ships entered the waters around the Diaoyu Islands. The Ministry added that the mission of China's ships was justified and legal. China hopes related parties will treat the issue objectively and rationally. The three surveillance ships belong to the South China Sea Fleet. They were the 168 Guangzhou guided missile destroyer, the 171 Haikou guided missile destroyer and the missile frigate 571 Yuncheng. Japan's Coast Guard spotted three Chinese maritime ships in waters 471 kilometers off the island of Okinawa. Japan said it would conduct a thorough investigation.\n\nA total of seven Chinese vessels registered under China's three People's Liberation Army Navy fleets (South Sea, East Sea and North Sea) sail near Japanese islands before returning to their bases on Oct. 28 and 29. The Type 052B (Guangzhou, 168 ) Destroyer and the Type 054A (Hunagshan, 570) Frigate, both from the South Sea Fleet, are followed by a Japanese destroyer when they sail through the waters at some 600 kilometers from Okinawa.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2004, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "DDG LUYANG I TYPE 052B CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.004.006.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 052B Class; Luyang I Class"}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "2 ships built of this class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Destroyer"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Jiangnan Shipyard"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "2004-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "280"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "155 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "17.2 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "6 m"}, {"name": "Displacement", "value": "5,850 tons standard; \n6,500 tons full load"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "Diesel"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "57,000 shp"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "30 knots"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "INA"}]}, {"name": "Gun Weapon Systems", "sections": [{"name": "Gun Weapon Systems #1: System", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "Type 210 100mm Dual Purpose Gun"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Dual Purpose Naval Gun"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "100mm"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "1\u00d7 Type 210 100 mm dual purpose gun"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "The Type 210 automatic single 100 mm naval gun is the Chinese modification of the Compact model of the French 100 mm naval gun.

Mao Zedong declared that China would build nuclear attack submarines even if it took ten thousand years. Peng Shilu was the first chief designer of this project. The first submarine in the class, the Long March I, was commissioned in 1974; the last was launched in 1990. In 1983, Peng shifted from the military to the civilian sector in the application of nuclear power plants, and his duty at the nuclear submarine project was succeeded by Huang Xuhua.\n\nThe Type 091 has operated mainly in local waters and has appeared in incidents. One submarine shadowed a U.S. carrier battle group in the mid-1990s. Another entered Japanese territorial waters through the Ishigaki, Okinawa island group near Taiwan in November 2004, causing Japan's maritime forces to go on alert for the second time since the Second World War; China apologized for the trespass and blamed \"technical reasons\" on the submarine.\n\nThe boats have received major upgrades and numerous refits since commissioning. They have six 533 mm (21 in) torpedo tubes and carry 20 torpedoes. Alternatively, they can carry 36 mines in their tubes. It is capable of firing sub-launched variants of the C-801 anti-ship missile as well as a range of indigenous and Russian torpedoes or mines. All remaining hulls have been refitted with new sonars, with Type H/SQ2-262B sonar manufactured by No. 613 Factory replacing the original Type 603 sonar on board.

A total of six vessels were delivered to the PLA Navy and form the main naval defense force currently protecting Hong Kong.\n\nThe original one-off design was by an American company, the H-3 group, the design was for a 245-ton boat, equipped with Harpoon SSMs, OTO Melara 76 mm guns, gas turbine engines, and waterjet propulsion. However, these specifications were too complicated for China, and a major redesign was begun, resulting in a boat with C-801 SSMs, diesel engines, and propellers instead. The OTO Melara 76mm gun was retained in the revised design, called in 1988 the EH-3D (and in 1996 the 520T), but failed to survive the cooling of relations with the West following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the resulting end of Western participation in Chinese military projects.\n\nThe first vessel was built in 1990, as a technology demonstrator and proof-of-concept trials vessel, it fired its first C-801 missile in a 1995 exercise. Three more vessels were built in 1995/96. However, due to technical difficulties (particularly with regards to the license-produced SEMT diesel engines), high price, and over-sophisticated design compared to the PLAN standard, further production was terminated. A fifth vessel, hull number 774, was built in 2001, as another proof of concept vessel for modified SEMT engines with new turbochargers and license-produced Russian AK-176 76 mm gun.\n\nFour vessels were built for rotation, with 2 vessels being deployed to Hong Kong at a time. The fifth vessel has been involved in two navigation incidents. The first time in 2001 whilst on a pre-delivery test it was nearly sunk after a crash with a fast ferry servicing the Hong Kong-Guangzhou route. In June 2006, it crashed again, this time with a Chinese freighter, and sank immediately, 13 servicemen going missing in the accident. The vessel was later refloated and sent to the shipyard for repair.\n\nThe Azmat-class vessels in service with the Pakistani Navy are based on this class.

industrial and manufacturing capabilities limited both classes from being mass-produced, resulting in only 20 Type 058 minesweeper and a single Type 7102 minesweeper being built.

The ship started in 1997 mainly for serving Thai Navy's light aircraft carrier and resupply convoy. \"Similan\" was built by China, with a full load displacement of 23,000 tons, the hull has two central depot systems, either oil-water supplies can also be dry supplies. For vertical replenishment, a helicopter deck and hangar were installed in the rear of the ship. The ship can carry 9,000 tons of oil and water, ammunition, and other supplies.\n\nOnce the start of construction of the Fuqing-class supply ship had already passed a quarter of a century, the Chinese finally began construction at the Shanghai East shipyard in 2002 of a new naval supply ship, similar to the Thai Navy's \"Similan\". Fu Chi class and \"Similan\" was both hull shape, the main structure is very similar. In fact, according to \"Jane's warships Yearbook)), the two main hull dimensions are basically the same. Of course, onboard equipment is different. , Fu Chi class and \"Similan\" was the same size as the main hull, but the stern of different shapes, probably because of the helicopter deck equipment is not the same.\n\nThe shape of the hull below the waterline and the hull structure may largely follow the \"Similan\" sign design. Because in the midships also designed the porthole, there may be a considerable portion of installed residential facilities. From the exterior view, Fu Chi class supply ship, including the bridge, helicopter base, and superstructure rear chimney larger, distinct from \"Similan\" was an almost complete absence of other large porthole design differences. Fu Chi class and \"Similan\" was installed in the same location in two groups maritime depot system, but with the latter two groups are oil and water, dry dual-use staging systems, Fu Chi class the oil depot system is front mounted, the rear is a dry goods depot system. In addition, the Fu Chi-grade oil depot system and the \"Nacang\" use the same model.\n\nOn 29 March 2003 the PLA launched a newly designed AOR, Qiandaohu No. 886, at which time a second was reported building. Initially, it was suggested that the ships were probably from the Dalian Shipyard, but later sources report they were from Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai. Her sister ship Weishanhu (887) was built by Huangpu Shipyard based in Guangzhou. The first-of-class was commissioned by the East Sea Fleet in April 2004. The second hull was launched in June 2003 and commissioned by the South Sea Fleet in late 2004. This class of ship was given the reporting name Fuchi class by NATO.\n\nThe ships are 171 meters long and displacing 22,000 tons at full load, with an armament of two Type 76A 37mm twin guns. The new oiler are of the same design as the Similan class (Hudong-Type R22T, named after the Similan Islands National Park off Thailand's West Coast, the best diving in Thailand) built for the Royal Thai Navy in 1995, and is comparable to the smaller French DURANCE class AOR. Like the Similan oiler, the ship has a flight deck and a hangar for one helicopter. The No. 886 class is powered by two license-built French-designed SEMT-Pielstick 12,000 brake-horsepower [BHP] diesel engines.\n\nThe pair of new No. 886 class AORs brought to five the total number of PLA Navy underway supply ships. The new class followed the Fuqing class, of which two units were built, and was needed to support the new Guangzhou-class (Type 052B/C) destroyers.\n\nJapan increased its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) out to 200 miles around its islands in 1996, and it overlapped China's EEZ in this area. After that began a noticeable increase in Chinese warships, research vessels and oil exploration vessels operating in and around the EEZ. China escalated its visibility when it sent a Sovremenny-Class ship, the most modern PLAN warship, into the waters of the Chunxiao oil-field on January 22, 2005. There was further escalation in September 2005 when a task group of five ships cruised Japanese EEZ oil-field waters. The flagship was Sovremenny hull 137, accompanied by Jianghu frigates 515 and 517, the 23,000-ton replenishment support ship Fuchi hull 886 and the 6,000-ton space event/intelligence ship Dongdiao, which bore hull number 851. Donadio, was hull number 232 when it intruded in 2000, indicating that Dongdiao had moved from the East Sea Fleet to the North Sea Fleet.\n\nThen in 2008, these ships became heavily used, supporting 13 task forces sent to the anti-piracy patrol off Somalia. Usually, one Type 903 accompanied two warships (usually a frigate and a destroyer), supplying fuel, water, food, and other supplies as needed. The replenishment ship would go to local ports to restock its depleted stores of fuel, water, food, and other necessities.\n\nChina needed more Type 903s to support the growing number of long distance training operations into the Western Pacific. One new Type 903 was launched in March 2012, and a second one two months later. Both underwent fitting out and sea trials. The first one launched in 2012 completed trials in nine months and the second one was apparently on the same fast track. Both Type 903s entered service in 2013.\n\nChina launched another Type 903 replenishment ship in mid-2013, around the same time the third one completed its first sea trials. China built and put into the water three more Type 903 replenishment ships in less than two years. A supply ship was commissioned for the East China Sea fleet of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy on 12 September 2013. The supply ship Chaohu is a Chinese-made ocean-going vessel capable of replenishing both dry and liquid cargo, said Zhang Weidong, the ship's captain. The ship, with hull number 890, successfully completed supply missions to two naval vessels during a trial voyage conducted recently, according to military sources. Chaohu has a displacement of more than 20,000 tons and is able to sail to all kinds of sea areas except polar and ice regions, according to Zhang.\n\nEarly 903 combined a number of Russian-made supply equipment, including the key horizontal supply system; the system by the Chinese Navy General Equipment Department and Russia contact, technical and price negotiations, by the China Poly Company is responsible for the purchase. Russia in addition to providing horizontal supply device, but also put forward the appearance of the supply mast and the force diagram, as well as the supply tank of the outline. The second batch of 903 type built in the 1920s (see below) began to use the Chinese-made horizontal supply device, and the first batch of 903 will also switch to domestic horizontal supply device.\n\nCompared with Thailand's Similan, 903 type of front and rear ship structure volume are slightly expanded, these signs show 903 type of living space after the increase, so speculation 903 also have to accommodate the command staff and personnel transport function; In addition, the structure of the 903 and the tin milan below the helicopter deck is also different. And the same number of the South warehouse, 903 is also equipped with a number of medical facilities and maintenance factories, both medical and repair ship part of the function. And China's second-line service ships the same, 903-type superstructure is also full of square portholes (tin Milano no). It is noteworthy that the tinmilan previously built for Thailand in order to tie in with the same period Thailand to Spain to buy light ship, and China from the beginning of 2000 began to plan to build aircraft carrier, so the 903 type of internal support configuration may Has been considered to the needs of the ship combat group.\n\n903-type tail with a helicopter library and flight deck, can carry a Russian-made Ka-27 transport helicopters, or two straight -9 helicopters, effective vertical filling operations. In addition, the tin milan on both sides of the stern are equipped with a boat pendant, 903 type is increased to two side of each boat pylon. Armed, the 903 has a four-door 76F double-mounted 37mm 63-speed fast gun, respectively, located in front of both sides of the bridge and helicopters on both sides of the top. Compared with the Fuqing level 76, 903 type 76F improved, with a closed turret cover, with automatic and manual operation of the two models, the maximum firing rate of 180 rounds / min, a range of 8.5km, but the ship is not set up supporting Of the radiation control radar (may only be equipped with a simple optical electronic control system), so the lack of night combat capability.\n\nOn March 22, 2012, Guangzhou Shipbuilding International built the third 903 type ship. The hangar was significantly larger than the original. At the beginning of 2012, pictures on the Internet showed that the Guangzhou Shipyard International Shipyard began construction of a new oil-oil supply ship, launched on March 22, 2012, its appearance is clearly 903 type of follow-up model, called 903A, the overall configuration was roughly the same, with many details and equipment improved, the appearance can be found in the helicopter door widened, can accommodate more helicopters; the original four 76A dual-mounted 37mm cannon also replaced by four in China in the early 2010 H / PJ-17 30mm cannon (see 056 frigate one), the ship was named Taihu Lake (889); and in the same period, Shanghai and Shanghai also built a homogeneous supply ship, and in May 7, 2012 The water was named Nest Lake (890). Taihu Lake on June 18, 2013 entered the North Sea Fleet service, Chaohu No. in September 12, 2013 into the East China Sea Fleet service.\n\nOn 31 May 2014, the People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) fifth Fuchi class Type 903A replenishment ship was launched at the Guangzhou International Shipyard in Guangzhou, China. With a 23,000 ton displacement capable of carrying 11,000 tons of supplies, the Type 903 class is China's most modern and largest indigenous replenishment oiler ship*, which resupplies warships at sea with fuel and other supplies. This 903A ship still needs to be fitted out with refueling and cross ship transfer conveyer belts. The Fuchi class's ability to transfer fuel and dry supplies to warships on the high seas in Underway Replenishment (UNREP) missions means that PLAN warships can remain on patrol instead of returning to port for fuel and food.\n\nWith the continuous service of large and medium-sized combat ships, the Chinese navy had a large number of ocean going vessels to supply and security capabilities put forward higher requirements, a large number of construction of new integrated supply ship has become a reasonable choice. On 27 December 2015, hull number 960 \"Dongping Lake\" ship formally entered service, so far, the Chinese Navy active duty 903A supply ship has reached 3 ships. According to the internet pictures, a follow-up of at least 3 ships with the type of ship in service, plus two aircraft 903 basic type, in shortly before July 15, 2016 China designed manufacturing new offshore supply ship Honghu ship, ship Luoma Lake into the column naming ceremony held at a naval base in Zhanjiang, Guangdong.

In August 2008 the Type 920 Hospital ship was reported to have successfully conducted a sea trial. The PLA Navy lists this ship as \"Type 920\" hospital ship. The ship name is \u201cYushan Island\u201d, and the number is 866. Because of the ship's function, the media reports use the term \"Square Boat\" and \"Peace Ark\" - Daishandao.\n\nThis vessel was launched in the ship yard of CSIC (Guangzhou Shipyard International Company Limited), which is a subsidiary of CSSC (China State Shipbuilding Corporation). The Type 920 Hospital Ship has a transom stem, a bulbous bow, an extended deckhouse with a forward bridge. A helicopter landing deck is on the stern of the vessel. Six Large Red-crosses have been painted on the ship body. The ship is approximately 170 meters long and 25 meters in beam and about 20,000-23,000 tons displacement [other estimates place the displacement at only 14,000 tons, while Xinhua reports 10,000 tons]. China did not give out any statistics, but based on Western hospital ships, the Type 920 probably has a ship crew of about 200 and a medical crew of about 600.\n\nA hospital ship would not seem necessary equipment in an amphibious invasion to Taiwan, since the island is so close to the mainland. However, for operations in the more distant waters of the South China Sea, it would be essential. The simultaneous appearance of the large Type 920 Hospital Ship and the Type 071 Yuzhao class amphibious transport seem to mark the beginnings of a major buildup in China's ability to project power into the South China Sea.\n\nThe primary mission of a U.S. Navy hospital ship is to provide rapid, flexible, and mobile acute medical care to support a Marine air/ground task force (MAGTF) deployed ashore, Army and Air Force units deployed ashore, and naval amphibious task forces and battle forces afloat. The Medical Treatment Facility provides a mobile, flexible and rapidly responsive afloat medical capability for acute medical and surgical care in support of amphibious task forces, Marine Corps, Army and Air Force elements, and forward deployed Navy elements of the fleet and fleet activities located in areas where hostilities may be imminent. As a secondary mission, they are capable of providing full hospital services for use of other government agencies involved in the support of relief and humanitarian operations worldwide. During World War II, in the final phases of the Pacific campaign, tactical doctrine for employment of Navy hospital vessels changed, allowing them to function as mobile, definitive-care combat hospitals in direct support of amphibious operations, rather than as transports only. Specially designed ships of the Haven (AH 12) class were built to support this concept.\n\nDriven by the development of China\u2019s overall economic strength, naval equipment construction, and even the Chinese army, the team's entire equipment construction achieved rapid development. At the same time, the development of the navy also greatly improved its concept. The Central Military Commission made a major decision on the strategic transformation of the navy, that is, the navy's defense from the offshore to the defense of the sea. In the process of such a big strategic change, the naval equipment construction, including the construction of the navy's medical service, has achieved great development. Reflected in this aspect of maritime medical care. In the construction of marine medical equipment, the \"one ship, five boats, four machines\" marine medical three-dimensional rescue equipment system including the first standard hospital ship in China.\n\nIn 2005, the design and launch of the Chinese Navy's 920 large medical vessel was launched. In 2006, the 920 hospital ship was started and was built by Guangzhou Shipyard International. In August 2007, the 920 hospital ship was launched. In October 2008, after a series of hull and shipboard medical equipment acceptance, 866 ships were delivered to the troops.\n\nThe hospital ship is a 14,000-ton large-scale professional hospital ship designed and developed by China. The ship has a total length of 178 meters, a maximum width of 24 meters and a full displacement of more than 14,000 tons. The ship has 10 departments and medical information centers such as rescue room, X-ray room, CT room, examination room and blood preparation room. The medical facilities are advanced, the nursing system is complete, and the medical equipment configuration is equivalent to the level of domestic third-class hospitals\n\nThe hospital boat is the most advanced type of equipment in the entire medical system architecture.

The last two units have large helicopter hangars and command facilities.\n\nThe KRI Teluk Ende (517) is the last ship of the Teluk Semangka class large landing ships, the final unit, is also outfitted as a hospital ship. KRI Teluk Ende-517 is named after Teluk Ende (Bay of Ende), which is also known as Baai van Endeh, Ende Baai, Hende, and H\u00e8nd\u00e9. Ende, with it's 60,000 residents is the biggest city on Flores. Located along the southern coast, it's hidden in the curve of a small peninsula. At both sides of it is a harbor. Most shipping activity is concentrated in Pelabuhan Ende, which is located at the western side and has a good view over Teluk Ende (Bay of Ende).\n\nIn February 2001 Dayak mobs hunted down and killed Madurese, including women, children and the elderly. The bloody attacks by indigenous Dayaks on Madurese migrants in the river town of Sampit, Central Kalimantan, have claimed hundreds of lives, mostly Madurese. It was a mad scramble as thousands of refugees trying to escape the riot which swept Sampit rushed to board a navy ship taking them away from ethnic violence which has claimed over 210 lives. But to the dismay of some 20,000 refugees who had gathered, only one ship, KRI Teluk Sampit, was docked and ready to be boarded at Samuda, some 40-kilometers south of Sampit. The ship had a capacity of less than 2,000. The refugees, mostly Madurese migrants, must await the arrival of the KRI Teluk Ende which had also been dispatched from Surabaya, East Java.\n\nIndonesian warship KRI Teluk Ende which arrived in Surabayae on 26 February 2001 with more than 3,200 refugees who became victims of the ethnic clashes in Sampit, Central Kalimantan, returned to the troubled area the next morning. \"As there had been requests for transport of more refugees, KRI Teluk Ende will return to Sampit, while KRI Teluk Sampit still remains in Surabaya for further orders,\" spokesman for the local naval authorities Lt Col Ditya Soedarsono said here Monday night. He said the 1,800 refugees, mostly Madurese, will also be brought to Surabaya, which is close to their hometowns in Madura.\n\nIndonesian Navy TELUK ENDE (517) was photographed at Surabaya on 27 November 2006, without red cross markings.\n\nTwo Indonesian's Navy Ships, KRI KI HAJAR DEWANTARA 364 and KRI TELUK ENDE 517, made a three days goodwill visit to Brunei Darussalam from 14 to 16 April 2009. Their arrivals at Muara Port were received by senior officers of Royal Brunei Navy and officials from The Embassy of the Republic of Indonesian.\n\nIn October 2010 Navy warship KRI Kalakay carryied at least six tons of basic necessaries from President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to Wasior in the district of Teluk Wondama in West Papua recently hit by flash floods. The Command has also sent three other warships to help overcome the impact of the disaster namely KRI Teluk Ende-517, KRI Fatahilah-361 and KRI dr Soeharto-990.

From 1978 to 1979, extensive trials were conducted and the ship was handed over to PLAN in early 1980, with pennant number East Transport 757 (East Transport = Dong Yun \u4e1c\u8fd0 in Chinese), meaning Transport 757 of East Sea Fleet of PLAN. This unit was later reassigned as # 937.\n\nThe primary difference between Type 073I and Type 073II is in the engine.

The class comprised 10 vessels, all of which remain in active service. Four of them are sold to the Bangladesh Navy. They were a follow-on of the Type 053H2G Jiangwei I class. The Zulfiquar-class frigate used by the Pakistan Navy was based on the Type 053H3.\n\nHistory\nIn the 1980s, the PLAN ordered Shanghai-based Hudong Shipyard (now Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard) to build a replacement for the Type 053K air defense frigate. The new class was based on the Type 053H2 frigate and designated Type 053H2G. Development was carried out under Project 055.\n\nThe Type 053H2G was slightly larger than the Type 053H2, and equipped with HQ-61B surface-to-air missiles (SAM). However, the HQ-61 proved unsatisfactory and the class was quickly superseded by the Type 053H3 which was an improved Type 053H2G equipped with HQ-7 SAMs. The HQ-7 was a Chinese-produced version of the French R330 Sea Crotale. Ten Type 053H3s were produced between 1996 and 2005.\n\nThe most obvious visual distinction between Jiangwei I & II are: The Jiangwei II's have HQ-7 instead of HQ-61B SAMs, 8 C-802 anti-ship missiles instead of 6, and aft AAA mounts elevated compared to the Jiangwei I. The Jiangwei II class was briefly equipped with HQ-61B SAM system before being replaced by HQ-7 during the upgrade, and some sources claim that the upgraded version is also called Type 057.\n\nMid-Life Upgrade\nA limited, mid-life upgrade was observed for the 053H3 starting in 2015.

A double-hulled catamaran, she was laid down at the Putilov Factory (now the Kirov Factory) in St. Petersburg in November 1912 as Volkhov. The ship was launched the following year and commissioned on 14 July 1915. She was renamed Kommuna on 31 December 1922. Kommuna has served in the Russian Imperial, Soviet, and Russian Federation navies through the Russian Revolution and two World Wars.  This specialized ship is the oldest operational warship in the World. \n\nHISTORY: \nThe ship was the first Russian double-hulled vessel and was developed by order of the Naval General Staff. SMS Vulkan was used as a prototype.\n\nThe contract to build the ship was won by the Putilov company, who received Order No. 3559 from the General Directorate of Shipbuilding on 30 December 1911, and the contract for construction was signed on 5 May 1912. The ship was laid down on 12 November 1912 under the supervision of naval architect N.V. Lesnikova. On 17 November 1913, the ship was launched under the name Volkhov and was commissioned into the Baltic Fleet on 15 July 1915.\n\nVolkhov was initially based at Reval where she served as a submarine tender, capable of carrying 10 spare torpedoes and 50 tons of fuel, as well as accommodation for 60 submariners. She serviced Russian submarines, and also British E and C-class submarines.\n\nVolkhov made her first successful salvage of a submarine in the summer of 1917, raising the Amerikanskiy Golland (Holland)-class submarine AG 15, which had sunk off the \u00c5land Islands. On 24 September 1917, Volkhov refloated the Bars-class submarine Edinorog from a depth of 13.5 meters (44 ft).\n\nFrom late 1917 Volkhov participated in the Civil War, serving the submarines of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, and on 31 December 1922 (just days after the founding of the USSR), she was renamed Kommuna. Under her new name, she continued in service in the Baltic, extinguishing a fire aboard the submarine Zmeya, and raising the despatch boat Kobchik, and the boat Krasnoarmeyets. In mid-1928 Kommuna raised the British submarine HMS L55, which had been sunk in the Gulf of Finland in June 1919, from a depth of 62 meters (203 ft), and which then served as the prototype for the Leninets class. Kommuna continued to serve as a salvage and repair ship, also raising a tug, a torpedo boat, and a crashed aircraft.\n\nFollowing the German invasion in June 1941 Kommuna was based at Leningrad, and although damaged by bombing continued to serve throughout the siege. In March 1942 she recovered four KV tanks, two tractors, and 31 vehicles from Lake Ladoga, which had fallen through the ice road, called the \"Road of Life\", which was Leningrad's only supply route. That year she also repaired six M-class submarines, as well as salvaging the Shchuka class 411, the tugboat Austra, the schooners Trud and Vodoley-2, and several other vessels. In February 1943, the crew of Kommuna was sent to the Volga where they recovered the tug Ivan and an Ilyushin Il-2 aircraft. In 1944, Kommuna recovered 14 wrecks, totaling 11,767 tons, and repaired 34 ships. Following the end of the siege, the entire crew was awarded the Medal \"For the Defence of Leningrad\". The ship continued to serve after the war, and in 1954 she was refitted and her engines were replaced by more modern Dutch ones. In November 1956 she located the submarine M-200, and in October 1957 raised the M-256.\n\nIn 1967, the ship sailed from the Baltic to the Black Sea and was refitted at a cost of 11 million rubles to carry submersibles. In 1974 she was equipped with a Type AS-6 Poisk-2 submersible, which on 15 December 1974 made a record dive to a depth of 2,026 meters (6,647 ft). In 1977 it was used in the search for a Sukhoi Su-24 aircraft that crashed and sank off the Caucasus at a depth of 1,700 meters (5,600 ft).\n\nIn 1984 the ship was laid up for transfer to the Russian Academy of Sciences. However, the transfer was canceled, and she was thoroughly looted and had to be completely refitted before returning to Naval service. In 1999 she was re-designated from \"salvage ship\" to \"rescue ship\".\n\nIn October 2009 she received a British-built submarine rescue submersible Pantera Plus, capable of operating to depths of up to 1,000 meters (3,300 ft). As of January 2012, she forms part of the detachment of rescue vessels based at Sevastopol.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1920, "countryOfOrigin": "Russia (RUS)", "proliferation": "Russian Federation", "selectedregions": ["All Regions"], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Russian Federation"], "dis": {"name": "Unknown", "string": "00.00.000.000.000.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Kommuna-Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Russian Submarine Salvage Ship"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Putilov Company, St. Petersburg"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "41", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Refit (1999)", "value": "A 1999 refit saw her outfitted as a submarine rescue ship, with modern equipment.

The ships can carry up to three utility boats. The ship regularly monitors the water area around the fleet\u2019s moorage sites, coastal assets, and military units of the Southern Military District. In 2011, Petr Gradov has carried out over 20 control raids around BSF basing sites, including those near the Caucasus Mountains. That made it possible to conduct ecological monitoring of the aquatic environment with mapping of pollution zones, provide ecological maintenance to the fleet\u2019s combat training activities, and collect data for environmental audits according to Russia\u2019s international commitments.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1978, "countryOfOrigin": "Russia (RUS)", "proliferation": "Russian Federation", "selectedregions": ["All Regions"], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Russian Federation"], "dis": {"name": "AGS FINIK I PROJECT 872 CLASS", "string": "01.03.222.016.033.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Finik-Class; Project 872 Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Hydrographic Survey Vessels"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Stocznia Polnocna, Gdansk, Poland"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "27 total (5 off. + 23 enl.)(all civilians) + 9 scientists"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "61.33 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "10.81 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "3.24 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Standard", "value": "939 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Full Load", "value": "1,190 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "2 Cegielski-Sulzer type 6AL25/30"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "Diesel"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "1,920 total bhp"}, {"name": "Auxiliary Power", "value": "2 143 hp (75-kW) electric motors for quiet 6 knot operations."}, {"name": "Bow Thruster", "value": "1 x 130 kW bow-thruster"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "3,045 nm at 13.4 knots; 4,356 nm at 11.8 knots"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "13.8 knots"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "15 days"}]}, {"name": "Radar Systems", "properties": [{"name": "Navigation Radar", "value": "2 x Kivach-B Navigation Radars."}]}, {"name": "Protection", "properties": [{"name": "Hull Armor", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Countermeasures", "value": "None"}, {"name": "NBC Water Washdown System", "value": "Yes"}, {"name": "EW Intercept", "value": "No"}]}], "variants": [{"name": "GS-260", "notes": "Commissioned: 1978\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-270", "notes": "Commissioned: 1978\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-272", "notes": "Commissioned: 1978\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-278", "notes": "Commissioned: 1978\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-388", "notes": "Commissioned: 1979\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-392", "notes": "Commissioned: 1979\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-401", "notes": "Commissioned: 1979\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-402", "notes": "Commissioned: 1979\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-403", "notes": "Commissioned: 1979\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-44", "notes": "Commissioned: 1979\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-47", "notes": "Commissioned: 1980\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-397", "notes": "Commissioned: 1980\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-398", "notes": "Commissioned: 1980\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-399", "notes": "Commissioned: 1980 \nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-400", "notes": "Commissioned: 1980\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-404", "notes": "Commissioned: 1981\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-405", "notes": "Commissioned: 1981\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-296", "notes": "Commissioned: 1982\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-297", "notes": "Commissioned: 1983\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-301", "notes": "Commissioned: 1983\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-84", "notes": "Commissioned: 1983\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-86", "notes": "Commissioned: 1983\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}, {"name": "GS-87", "notes": "Commissioned: 1983\nStatus: Active\nFleet: INA"}], "type": "WEG", "version": 1}, "images": [{"name": "FINIK-class_SURVEY_(AA).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/f/fa/FINIK-class_SURVEY_%28AA%29.jpg"}, {"name": "FINIK-class_SURVEY_(BB).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/5/50/FINIK-class_SURVEY_%28BB%29.jpg"}, {"name": "FINIK-class_SURVEY_(CC).png", "url": "/mediawiki/images/d/dc/FINIK-class_SURVEY_%28CC%29.png"}], "categories": ["WEG", "Naval Watercraft", "Intelligence Collection Ships", "Russia (RUS)", "PRO_Russian Federation", "Sea", "Tier3"]}, {"title": "Yug-Class (Project 862 Class) Russian Hydrographic Survey Vessel", "id": 14234, "json": {"tiers": [false, false, true, false], "notes": "Yug-Class (Project 862 Class) Russian Hydrographic Survey Vessel was placed in service between May of 1978 and Sept. 6, 1983.

The Collins class takes its name from Australian Vice Admiral John Augustine Collins; all six submarines are named after significant RAN personnel who distinguished themselves in action during World War II. The boats were the first submarines to be constructed in Australia, prompting widespread improvements in Australian industry and delivering a sovereign (Australian controlled) sustainment/maintenance capability.\n\nPlanning for a new design to replace the RAN's Oberon-class submarines began in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Proposals were received from seven companies; two were selected for a funded study to determine the winning design, which was announced in mid-1987. The submarines, enlarged versions of Swedish shipbuilder Kockums' V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland class and originally referred to as the Type 471 were constructed between 1990 and 2003 in South Australia by the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC).\n\nThe submarines have been the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the design phase, including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines\u2014by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative press has led to a poor public perception of the Collins class. After 20 years of service issues, the boats have finally provided high availability to the RAN since 2016.\n\nThe Collins class was expected to be retired about 2026, however, the 2016 Defence White Paper extended this into the 2030s. The Collins class life will now be extended and will receive an unplanned capability upgrade, including but not limited to sonar and communications.\n\nThe Collins class will be replaced by the Future Submarine Program (SEA 1000) that is scheduled, according to the 2016 Defence White Paper, to begin entering service in the early 2030s with construction extending to 2050. The Future Submarine Program will be based on the Shortfin Barracuda, a nuclear attack submarine designed by French company DCNS; twelve submarines will be acquired, all built-in Australia.\n\nThe Australian Submarine Corporation construction facility was established on previously undeveloped land on the bank of the Port River, at Osborne, South Australia. Work on the site began on 29 June 1987, and it was opened in November 1989. South Australia was selected as the site of the construction facility based on the proposed location of the facility and promises by the State Government to help minimize any problems caused by workers' unions. The state's bid was aided by careful promotion to both Kockums and IKL/HDW during early in the project, and problems with the other states' proposals: Tasmania and Western Australia lacked the necessary industrial base, New South Wales could not decide on the location of the construction facility, Victoria's proposed site was poorly sited, and building in Liberal-led Queensland would have been politically unwise for the project when Labor was in power both federally and in all other states.\n\nEach submarine was constructed in six sections, each consisting of several sub-sections. One of the main criteria of the project was that Australian industries contribute to at least 60% of the work; by the conclusion of the project, 70% of the construction and 45% of the software preparation had been completed by Australian-owned companies. Work was sub-contracted out to 426 companies across twelve countries, plus numerous sub-sub-contractors. In many cases, components for the first submarine were constructed by companies outside Australia, while those for the following five boats were replicated by an Australian-owned partner or subsidiary. The project prompted major increases in quality control standards across Australian industries: in 1980, only 35 Australian companies possessed the appropriate quality control certifications for Defence projects, but by 1998 this had increased to over 1,500.\n\nAlthough the acquisition project organizers originally planned for the first submarine to be constructed overseas, the Cabinet decided as part of the project's approval that all six submarines would be built in Australia; the increases in construction time and cost from not building the lead ship in the winning designer's home shipyard was considered to be offset by the additional experience provided to Australian industries. Even so, two sections of the first submarine were constructed by Kockums' shipyard in Malmo, Sweden.\n\nBy the end of 1990, Chicago Bridge & Iron and Wormald International had both sold their shares in ASC. The shares were bought up by Kockums and the Australian Industry Development Corporation, with some of Kockums' shares then sold to James Hardie Industries to maintain Australian majority ownership of the company. On 5 April 2000, the shares in ASC held by Kockums were bought out and the company was nationalized, despite a trend at the time to privatize government-owned companies. At the end of 2003, a contract to maintain the Collins class worth $3.5 billion over 25 years was awarded to ASC.\n\nAs of April 1996, the option to order the seventh and eighth submarines was still under consideration but was looked on unfavorably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force. The option was canceled outright by late 2001.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1996, "countryOfOrigin": "Australia", "proliferation": "All Regions, Australia", "selectedregions": ["All Regions"], "checkedregions": ["All Regions"], "checkedcountries": ["Australia"], "dis": {"name": "SSG COLLINS CLASS", "string": "01.04.013.004.001.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Collins-Class; Type 471 Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Diesel-Electric Submarine"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Australian Submarine Corporation\nKockums"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "42 (6 off. + 36 enl.)"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "77.4 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "7.8 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "7.0 m"}, {"name": "Draught", "value": "7 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Light", "value": "2,450 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Surface", "value": "3,051 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Submerged", "value": "3,353 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "3 x Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18B/15Ub (VB 210) 18-cylinder diesel generator sets; 1 x Jeumont-Schneider electric motor"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "Diesel-electric drive"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "7,200 total shp"}, {"name": "Shaft", "value": "1", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Speed, Surface", "value": "10.5 knots"}, {"name": "Speed, Submerged", "value": "21.0 knots"}, {"name": "Range, Surface", "value": "11,500 nm at 10 knots"}, {"name": "Range, Snorkeling", "value": "9,000 nm at 10 knots"}, {"name": "Range, Submerged", "value": "480 nm at  4 knots"}, {"name": "Diving Depth", "value": ">180 m"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "70 Days"}]}, {"name": "Main Weapon System", "sections": [{"name": "Missile System", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "23 x AGM-84 Harpoon Long-Range Sea-Skimming, Anti-Ship Missile"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Long-Range Sea-Skimming, Anti-Ship Missile"}, {"name": "Variants", "value": "AGM-/RGM-84A;\nUGM-84B;\nRGM-84C (Block 1B production variant);\nAGM-/RGM-/UGM-84D (Block 1C);\nAGM-/RGM-84F (Block 1D);\nRGM-84G/UGM-84G Block 1G;\nAGM-84H SLAM-ER (Extended Response);\nSLAM-ATA (Automatic Target Acquisition) Block 1G;\nLand-launched coastal defense;\nHarpoon 2000/Block II;\nAGM-84M Harpoon Block III;\nAGM-84N Harpoon Block II+"}, {"name": "Proliferation", "value": "The AGM-/RGM-/UGM-84 Harpoon is a long-range sea-skimming, anti-ship missile that is the most widely used anti-ship missile in the West."}, {"name": "Length", "value": "3.90 m"}, {"name": "DIameter", "value": "340mm"}, {"name": "Wingspan", "value": "0.91 m"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "531.6 kg"}, {"name": "Warhead Type", "value": "Conventional high-explosive with some penetration capability."}, {"name": "Warhead Weight", "value": "227 kg"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "Mach 0.85"}, {"name": "Range", "value": "75-80 nm (139-148 km)"}, {"name": "Targeting", "value": "HCLS provides targeting data; no updates once missile is launched."}, {"name": "Guidance", "value": "on-board Midcourse Guidance Unit (MGU)-IBM digital computer Smiths Industries three-axis ARA  Honeywell AN/APN-194."}, {"name": "Missile Basic Load", "value": "23 x AGM-84 Harpoon Long-Range Sea-Skimming, Anti-Ship Missile."}]}, {"name": "Torpedo System", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "23 x Mk 48 Mod 7 Heavy Torpedo"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Heavy Torpedo"}, {"name": "Variants", "value": "Ex-10 RETORC (Research Torpedo Configuration);\nMk 48 Mod 0/2;\nMk 48 Mod 1;\nMk 48 Mod 3;\nMk 48 Mod 4;\nMk 48 Mod 5;\nMk 48 Mod 6;\nMk 48 Mod6AT;\n\"Full-up\" ADCAP;\nClosed-Cycle Advanced Capability Propulsion System (CCACPS);\nMk 48 Mod 7 ADCAP CBASS;\nHalf-Length Mk 48"}, {"name": "Proliferation", "value": "It is the principal weapon of U.S. attack submarines, being a successor to the Mk 37.

They were commissioned between 1983 and 1984, after the Falklands War. The class comprises four ships; Almirante Brown, La Argentina, Hero\u00edna and Sarand\u00ed. They are classified as either frigates or destroyers by different publications. The MEKO 360 type warships are based on modular designs which allow quick changes to the vessel's armaments depending on mission requirements. The modular nature of the construction also allows the ships to be modernized or refitted with greater ease. Six vessels were initially ordered, however two ships were cancelled and replaced with orders for MEKO 140 type hulls.\n\nOrdered in 1979, construction of the ships was delayed as the British turbines were embargoed after the Falklands War. Furthermore, the acquisition of helicopters for the vessels has seen many incarnations. They were initially intended to be equipped with Westland Lynx helicopters, but the order was cancelled in 1982. The planned replacement Agusta-Bell AB 212 helicopters were not funded and instead, all of the Almirante Brown class deploy with AS 555 Fennec, while only La Argentina and Sarand\u00ed can employ SH-3D Sea King helicopters. Almirante Brown took part in Gulf War operations in 1990. All of the ships can be used as flagships.\n\n\nSix vessels were ordered and four vessels of a second variant, MEKO 360H2, were constructed for Argentina. They were locally named the Almirante Brown class. They are considered frigates and destroyers by different publications. The design is based on the concept of modular systems and is capable of changing the armament of the ship swiftly and can be modernized/refitted with more ease. Each ship is capable of being used as a flagship.\n\nThe ships have a standard displacement of 2,900 long tons (2,900 t) and 3,360 long tons (3,410 t) at full load. The vessels are 125.9 metres (413 ft 1 in) long overall and 119.0 metres (390 ft 5 in) between perpendiculars with a beam of 15 metres (49 ft 3 in) and a draught of 5.8 metres (19 ft 0 in). The vessels are powered by a COGOG system driving two shafts composed of two Olympus TM 3B gas turbines rated at 51,800 shaft horsepower (38,600 kW) and two Tyne RM-IC gas turbines rated at 10,200 shaft horsepower (7,600 kW). The ships have a maximum speed of 30.5 knots (56.5 km/h; 35.1 mph) while using their Olympus gas turbines at 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph) using their Tyne turbines. The MEKOs have a maximum range of 4,500 nautical miles (8,300 km; 5,200 mi) at 18 knots.\n\nThe Argentinian vessels are armed with eight Exocet surface-to-surface missiles in two quad launchers mounted centrally and one octuple launcher for Aspide surface-to-air missiles mounted aft of the superstructure. The MEKO 360H2 are also equipped with one OTO Melara 5-inch (127 mm)/54 calibre naval gun forward of the superstructure, eight Bofors 40 mm/70 calibre guns, and two triple-mounted 324 mm (13 in) ILAS torpedo tubes.\n\nThe ships are equipped with a Graseby G1738 towed decoy countermeasure system, two Breda 105 mm (4 in) SCLAR chaff rocket launchers with each launcher sporting 20 tubes. For electronic support measures, the vessels are armed with the Sphinx system and the Scimitar system for electronic countermeasures. The class is equipped with two Signaal DA08A air/surface search radar operating on the F band and Signaal ZW06 surface search radar operating on I band. They have Decca 1226 navigational radar operating on the I band and their fire control systems are controlled by the Signaal SEWACO Link 10/11 system supported by Signaal STIR radar operating on the I/J and K bands, Signaal WM25 operating on I and J band, along with LIRODA radar systems that control the 40 mm gun mounts. For sub-surface search, the vessels have Atlas Elektronik 80 hull-mounted active search sonar.\n\nAll of the Almirante Brown class are equipped with a helicopter deck and hangar. They all deploy with AS 555 Fennec helicopters, while only La Argentina and Sarand\u00ed can employ SH-3D Sea King helicopters.

frigate is a class of Chinese multi-role frigates, the first of which entered service with the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force in 2007. It is a development of the Type 054 frigate, using the same hull but with improved sensors and weapons.\n\nThe Type 054A was first revealed while under construction at the Guangzhou-based Huangpu Shipyard in 2005.\nThe Type 054A carries HQ-16 medium-range air defence missiles and anti-submarine missiles in a vertical launching system (VLS) system. The HQ-16 has a range of up to 50 km, with superior range and engagement angles to the Type 054's HQ-7. The Type 054A's VLS uses a hot launch method; a shared common exhaust system is sited between the two rows of rectangular launching tubes.\n\nThe four AK-630 close-in weapon systems (CIWS) of the Type 054 were replaced with two Type 730 CIWS on the Type 054A. The autonomous Type 730 provides improved reaction time against close-in threats.\n\nThe Type 054A retains its predecessor's stealth features, including sloped hull design, radar absorbent materials, and a clean profile.\n\nAn improved variant beginning with the 17th unit launched from Huangpu Shipyard in 2009 has the seven-barrelled Type 730 CIWS replaced by the more capable 11-barrelled Type 1130, and is unofficially referred as Type 54A+. Another reported improvement over the original Type 054A includes the incorporation of variable depth sonar and towed array sonar.\n\nType 054A frigate made its first operational deployment to the Gulf of Aden, when 570 Huangshan set sail as part of 2nd Escort Flotilla/Task Group 167 on 2 April 2009, the Escort Flotilla arrived there on 13 April 2009, and took over form 1st Escort Flotilla/Task Group 169 on 15 April 2009. Since then, 11 Type 054A have deployed to the Gulf of Aden for anti-piracy operations.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Libyan civil war, 530 Xuzhou was deployed from anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden to help evacuate Chinese nationals from Libya.\n\nIn January 2014, 546 Yancheng was redeployed from anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden to the eastern Mediterranean Sea to escort Syrian chemical weapons destined for destruction.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2008, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [],

The ship was launched in May 1994 and commissioned in September 2000, following sea trials that began in January 1999. As a result of trials, the landing deck has been lengthened by 4.4m to enable the E-2C to land and clear the deck quickly.\n\nThe carrier was due to enter service in December 2000, but, following the breakage of a propeller blade during long-distance trials, this was delayed to April 2001. In June 2001, the carrier took part in exercises in the Mediterranean and in December 2001 left to take part in Operation Enduring Freedom where it was stationed in the Arabian Gulf. It returned to its home port of Toulon in July 2002. Super Etendard and Hawkeye E-2C aircraft carried out a number of sorties but the ship\u2019s F1 standard Rafale M fighters did not take part in operations, although they were included in exercises with the US Navy.\n\nIn April 2007, DCN became DCNS. This followed an agreement in which Thales became a 25% shareholder in the new company and DCN acquired the naval business of Thales France (excluding naval equipment).\n\nIn September 2007, Charles de Gaulle began a refit, which included overhaul and refuelling of the nuclear propulsion system and installing a new SYTEX command and control system with Syracuse III satellite communications system.\n\nThe combat system has also been adapted for operations with the Rafale F3 equipped with AASM, ASMPA and Scalp-EG missiles. The refit was completed and the carrier returned to the French Navy in December 2008.\n\nDCNS completed an intermediate refit of Charles de Gaulle in July 2013 and works included painting of the ship, systems inspection, refurbishing of galley, and 35km of cabling and replacement of stabilisation computer.\n\nDCNS performed second major technical shutdown and mid-life refit of Charles de Gaulle from February 2017 to November 2018 to extend the life of the vessel for an additional 25 years.\n\nThe maintenance works included overall replacement of the control room, modernisation of tactical system, refurbishment of telecommunication systems, replacement of radars, as well as the renovation and recalibration of the steering control system. The aviation installations and spaces were also modernised as part of the refit.\n\nThe French Navy\u2019s plans of a second carrier have been put on hold. The new carrier will not be the same class as the Charles de Gaulle, but will be a conventionally powered carrier. It will be built by DCNS.\n\nThe design phase for the carrier programme (PA2) was launched in January 2005. In December 2005, following discussions between the French and UK governments on the possibility of a joint development with the UK\u2019s CVF carrier project, which Thales UK is designing, it was agreed that France would pay one-third of the costs of the demonstration phase of the baseline CVF design.\n\nThe ship can operate a fleet of up to 40 aircraft: Rafale M (range 3,340km), Super Etendard (range 1,682km) and three E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft. The ship also supports Dolphin PEDRO, AS 565 Panther or NH 90 helicopters.\n\nThe main deck consists of a main runway angled at 8.5\u00b0 to the ship\u2019s axis and an aircraft launch area forward of the island. These are each equipped with a USN-type C13 catapult, capable of launching one aircraft a minute. The runway is 195m long and the whole deck measures 260m x 64m. The carrier is fitted with the Sagem Defense S\u00e9curit\u00e9 (formerly EADS Defence and Electronics) DALAS laser landing aid.\n\nThe carrier is fitted with the SATRAP computerised, integrated stabilisation system designed to maintain stabilisation to within 0.5\u00b0 of horizontal, allowing aircraft to be operated up to sea state 5/6. As well as the carrier\u2019s two pairs of active stabilising fins and twin rudders, the system has two computer-controlled compensation units consisting of two rail tracks for trains carrying 22t of deadweight.\n\nThese tracks run transversely below the flight deck. This system is designed to compensate for wind and heel and control roll, yaw and surge.\n\nThe ship\u2019s weapons are managed by a Senit combat management system, which has the capacity to track up to 2,000 targets. The weapon control system consists of two Vigy 105 optronic directors supplied by Sagem. The ship also has two Sagem Vampir search and track systems.\n\nIn February 2004, Thales was awarded a contract for a new command and control system for the French Navy. The new SYTEX system is being fitted on the Charles de Gaulle as well as other vessels and shore locations and allows the vessel to access national or coalition command networks.\n\nThe ship is armed with two surface anti-air missile (SAAM) () system, developed by Eurosam (set up by MBDA and Thales) for defence against hostile aircraft and anti-ship missiles. The system uses the Aster 15 surface-to-air missile and entered operational service in November 2002, with the first firing of the missile from the Charles de Gaulle.\n\nThe Aster missile has a 13kg warhead and a range of 30km. The missile\u2019s guidance is inertial with data uplink and active radar terminal homing. For increased manoeuvrability in the terminal phase, the missile uses a \u2018PIF-PAF\u2019 direct thrust control system with gas jets. Two eight-cell Sylver vertical launch systems are installed on the starboard side forward of the bridge and two on the port side aft of the bridge.\n\nThe system uses the Thales (formerly Thomson-CSF) Arabel radar, which is a multi-function three-dimensional radar with a range of 70km for a target area of 2m\u00b2.\n\nThe ship has two six-cell Sadral launching systems for the MBDA (formerly Matra BAe Dynamics) Mistral anti-aircraft and anti-missile missile. Mistral has an infra-red seeker and a range of 4km.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1994, "countryOfOrigin": "France", "proliferation": "France", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["France"], "dis": {"name": "CVN CHARLES DE GAULLE CLASS", "string": "01.03.071.001.001.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Charles de Gaulle;

They received the NATO reporting name of Yuting II. Derived from the Type 072III, the most obvious visual difference between the Type 072A and all earlier models of the Type 072 series is that the step of the stepped superstructure on all earlier models has been eliminated. In addition, the Type 072A is designed to accommodate air-cushioned landing craft by incorporating a deck well. Like its predecessor the Type 072III, the Type 072A has a helipad but no hangar. The Type 072A is designed to carry 10 tanks, 4 landing craft, a medium helicopter, and air-cushioned vehicles; a total of 250 fully armed troops can be carried.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Type 072A Yuting-II is a class of large landing ships developed as an enlarged version of the Type 072-III landing craft adding an aft helicopter deck for a medium-sized helicopter and more room for troops. The 5,000-ton class vessel propulsion system is based on two diesel engines developing a top speed of 21 knots. These ships can transport a payload of 500 tons and are provided with one dual 37mm gun to provide fire support during landing operations. The ship accommodates up to 250 fully equipped marines.

A sister Project 22010-class ship \"Almaz\" is also under construction.\n\nYantar was designed by the CMDB Almaz Design Bureau in St. Petersburg, and the hull was laid down on 8 July 2010. It was launched in December 2012 and concluded its sea trials in May 2015. The ship has a length of 108 meters (354 ft) and a full displacement of 5,736 tons. It uses diesel-electric propulsion for a top speed of approximately 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph). It officially has a complement of 60. The ship was built at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad.\n\nYantar can act as a mothership to mini-subs. The United States Navy has stated that the submersibles are able to sever cables miles beneath the ocean's surface.

The first Type 908 replenishment ship, Qinghaihu, was originally laid down for the Soviet Navy as a Komandarn Fedko-class merchant tanker, but construction was halted due to insufficient funds. The ship was then purchased by China as an incomplete vessel in 1993 from post-Soviet Ukraine. The ship has a near sister ship (INS Jyoti) operating with the Indian Navy. After significant refit, the ship was consecutively renamed Qinghaihu (885), formerly ex Nancang (Nanyun 953) and ex-Vladimir Peregudov. Another similar ship was built and sold to Thailand and currently in service with the Royal Thai Navy as HTMS Similan (871).\n\nThe Type 908 AOR is the second generation Chinese replenishment ship that is outfitted with a total of six cranes, four oil refuelling stations, and two stores stations. This allows the ship to replenish three warships simultaneously. The ship, through her helicopter facilities, is able to replenish warships operating nearby via vertical replenishment (VERTREP).\n\nThe Type 908 was the second stage in Chinese replenishment ship development and construction. Although considered somewhat successful, the first Type 905 replenishment tanker (Fuqing class) could not completely satisfy the requirements of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). One of the primary drawbacks of this class was that they are mainly for replenishment of liquid supplies, i.e. fuel and water. These ships of the first stage of the development of Chinese replenishment ships could only replenish extremely limited dry supplies, and are virtually incapable of resupply of ammunition, because the Chinese industry at the time lacked the capability to provide sounding safety measures for resupplying and storing ammunition with fuels. This is one of the two primary constrains that despite the fact that on August 28, 1977, the Central Military Commission ordered the resumption of the development of fleet replenishment ship that is capable of one-stop replenishment, (i.e. being capable of resupply ammunition, fuels, water, and solid supplies together by a single ship, a concept first pioneered by United States Navy), the project was eventually put on hold.\n\nThe other primary constrain was budget constraints as Chinese economy was near the verge of total collapse resulting from the Cultural Revolution. Eventually, as the economic reform in the People's Republic of China in 1979 rapidly improved the Chinese economy, the second stage of the development of the Chinese fleet replenishment ship was resumed in 1988, after around a decade of dormancy. PLAN had a lot of expectations for the new class of ship: in addition to being capable of one-stop replenishment, the new ship was also required to be capable of serving as a hospital ship. However, to meet such high expectation of PLAN, costs was driven up multiple times. As the design was completed, the price of the proposed new ship exceeded what PLAN could afford and the project was in danger of being cancelled again.\n\nOn May 1, 1993, the uncompleted former Soviet naval ship was towed to Dalian shipyard from Ukrainian Kherson shipyard. In addition to the hull and subsystems, China also purchased the design, which was immediately modified to meet the Chinese needs. Chinese Academy of Sciences academician Zhang Wende (\u5f20\u6587\u5fb7), the original chief designer of the second generation domestic Chinese replenishment ship was named as the chief designer and the program manager of this conversion project. The deputy general designer is Mr. Huang Wei (\u9ec4\u851a), another general engineer of the 701st Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC). On May 8, 1996, it entered Chinese service in South Sea Fleet, where it has remained until today. The pennant number was originally Nanyun (\u5357\u8fd0)-953, but later changed to 885, with name Qinghaihu (\u9752\u6d77\u6e56), and this upgraded ship became the second generation Chinese replenishment ship, replacing the originally planned indigenous one.\n\nThe conversion project was deemed successful and worthy but Chinese, who had gained important insights on Soviet design principle, core technologies, important subsystems, layout, and other expertise that were difficult for Chinese to obtain, and these valuable knowledge would later help China in designing its next generation replenishment ships. The most important gain, however, was financial. The original funding that was insufficient to develop a proposed indigenous 2nd generation Chinese replenishment ship was not only enough to buy the uncompleted former Soviet ship, but also had enough left to cover the following conversion work. One of the primary areas of improvement of the original former-Soviet design was in damage control, which was woefully inadequate (Rumored due to its original civilian merchant tanker design). Some of the interior wiring was exposed, and the ship's battle damage control system was very limited, with a near absence of internal damage limitation, insufficient fire-suppression system and water-tight locks. Incorporate the experienced gained from the rework of Type 053 frigates exported to Royal Thai Navy, the damage control of the ship was upgraded to western (mostly German and American) standards. There are a total of four transfer stations, with dry cargo transfer station followed by liquid cargo transfer station, which is exactly the opposite of arrangement of other replenishment ships in Chinese service, which is the major reason for China to indigenously develop the third generation replenishment ship.

China decided to join the bid, among other western shipbuilders including DCNS, Fincantieri, BAZAN, Hyundai and Dutch Schelde shipyards, and the Chinese design would be very similar to the converted former-Soviet ship, with work on both ships would be performed simultaneously. The original chief designer of the cancelled second generation domestic Chinese replenishment ship, academician Zhang Wende (\u5f20\u6587\u5fb7), who was named as the chief designer and the program manager of the conversion project for the Chinese navy, was also assigned an additional task, as the chief designer of second ship China would be building for export to the Thai navy. China managed to beat its western competitors and won the Thai contract.\n\nWork on the ship built for the Royal Thai Navy went well and the ship was completed on August 12, 1996. Zhang Wende, the chief designer personally stayed on board the ship for twelve days during the voyage to Thailand, gathering information at the very last moment, so that it would help in the future design of the next generation Chinese replenishment ship. Whenever possible, Zhang personally operated the ship, including radars, handling boats the ship carried, and other tasks. The ship was formally accepted to the Thai naval service on September 12, 1996, and was named HTMS Similan (pennant number 187).\n\nHTMS Similan is very similar to its sister ship in Chinese service, except it uses a Chinese hull. The most important difference, however, is in upgrading its replenishment capability. Despite being able to replenish solid supplies, the capability to resupply ammo is still rather limited for the Chinese ship. The Thai ship has further overcome this problem by increasing the ammunition resupply capability. Despite the difference between two ships, most of the technologies and components, especially those core technologies for both ships remain the same, and for this reason, China has placed HTMS Similan and the Chinese ship Qinghaihu (\u9752\u6d77\u6e56) in the same class.

During the Vietnam War, there were two new aluminum LCM-8s on Johnston Island, which carried trucks and cargo between islands, and one being used as a rescue boat. They had the newer fluid shift transmissions, and 2-671's paired up to two props.\n\nIn I Corps (the northernmost military district in Vietnam) boats based at Da Nang, Tan My and C\u1eeda Vi\u1ec7t had three-man crews of various rates and ranks. On U.S. Navy boats, the senior rate was usually a third-class petty officer or above, and the two crewmen could be E-2, E-3, or E-4 ranks (i.e. seaman apprentice, seaman, or petty officer third class). One of the two crewmen was almost always an Engineman and could be an ENFA, ENFN, or an EN3 in rank. The LCM-8s there all had two sets of twin 6-71 Detroits paired up to a hydro transmission. Two air compressors, port, and starboard of the engine sets, provided air pressure to operate the air cylinders that raised and lowered the bow ramp. The air cylinders were below deck in the eighth void from the bow and stretched cables attached to the ramp to raise it. Lowering the ramp was accomplished by releasing the air and allowing gravity to bring the ramp down.\n\nThey also saw use during Operation Just Cause in Panama as well as Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Three Army LCM-8s served in the 1992\u20131993 US mission to Somalia (fictionalized in Christian Bauman's 2002 novel The Ice Beneath You, which is set in part on a US Army LCM-8 near Kismaayo, Somalia), and a platoon of LCM-8s from the 1098th Trans Co. deployed to Port-au-Prince for the Haitian invasion (1994). The United States Army Reserve's 464th Transportation Company assisted the United States Coast Guard in patrolling the Potomac River after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\nSome are currently deployed aboard Maritime Prepositioning ships to facilitate their mission of being able to unload all their cargo while still offshore with no outside assistance.\n\nThe LCM-8 was constructed in Australia for the Australian Army from 1965 to 1967 and again in 1972 using a heavily modified design, crewed (four) and administered by the Royal Australian Corps of Transport and one engineer from the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (RAEME). The modification of the vessels included an extended enclosed wheelhouse with full galley facilities, a chart table, and storage space to aid in extended operations beyond the original design parameters. A water purification system allows the vessels to be somewhat independent for longer periods of time. A fully functioning toilet (head) and shower are also installed as part of the wheelhouse extensions; external provision for bedding is also included for the full crew complement.\n\nThe extension of the wheelhouse increased the rigidity of the craft leading to excessive vibration and cavitation with the original three-blade propeller. Further development included a more balanced and expensive five-blade propeller, negating the vibration and cavitation of the original. The prop change found a few negative effects on the beaching performance of the vessel but over time tactics have been changed to suit the new system.\n\nThe vessels are also installed with a full suite of electronics allowing the craft to navigate in all weather, day or night in military operations anywhere in the world with little to no special training requirements for an indefinite period.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, the Army LCM-8 received a life of type extension with a re-engine program. The original twin-pac 6-71 two-stroke Detroit Diesel engines and Allison mechanical transmissions were replaced with 8v-92 Silver Series Detroit Diesel engines and Allison Hydraulic Transmissions thus extending the life of the craft for another 20 years.\n\nTwo craft were utilized during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, patrolling the shallow waters of the Khawr Abd Allah estuary using HMAS Kanimbla as their base of operations. They were extensively used in East Timor for logistic operations in direct support of multinational peacekeepers. Other deployments include peacekeeping and peace monitoring operations in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe LCM-8 fleet of fifteen was to be replaced by six Australian designed type LCM2000 waterjet propelled craft, however, these crafts were scrapped, after not meeting the required in-service specifications and being deemed not fit for use for the intended Kanimbla-class. The Army will now continue to operate the LCM-8 until 2027.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1959, "countryOfOrigin": "United States", "proliferation": "Australia, Cambodia, France, India, Laos (People's Democratic Republic), South Korea (Republic of Korea), Thailand, Tonga, Turkey, United States of America, Viet Nam", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Australia", "Cambodia", "France", "India", "Laos (People's Democratic Republic)", "South Korea (Republic of Korea)", "Thailand", "Tonga", "Turkey", "United States of America", "Viet Nam"], "dis": {"name": "LCM 8 CLASS", "string": "01.03.225.011.009.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "LCM-8; \"Mike Boat\""}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Landing Craft Mechanized"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "1967-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "4-6", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Cargo Capacity", "value": "54.4 tons of cargo"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "22.265 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "6.4 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "1.234 m light; 1.60 m loaded"}, {"name": "Displacement, Light", "value": "57.8 long tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Full Load", "value": "111.4 long tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "2-twin-pak GMC 6-71 or Gray Marine 6-71 diesel paired to 2 hydrostatic transmissions Detroit 12V-71 diesel engines"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "Diesel"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "12 knots (22 km/h) light\n9 knots (17 km/h) loaded"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Screws", "value": "2", "units": "ea"}]}, {"name": "Main Armament", "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "1 x M2 Browning 12.7mm Heavy Machine Gun"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Heavy Machine Gun"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "12.7mm"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "2", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "1,654 mm"}, {"name": "Barrel Length", "value": "1,143 mm"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "38 kg"}, {"name": "Action", "value": "Short recoil-operated"}, {"name": "Rate of Fire", "value": "450\u2013600 rounds/min"}, {"name": "Muzzle Velocity", "value": "890 m/s"}, {"name": "Maximum Firing Range", "value": "7,400 m"}, {"name": "Effective Firing Range", "value": "1,800 m"}, {"name": "Feed System", "value": "Belt-fed (M2 or M9 links)"}]}, {"name": "Ammunition", "properties": [{"name": "Type", "value": "Rifle"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "12.7", "units": "mm"}, {"name": "Cartridge", "value": "12.7\u00d799mm NATO"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "600 rounds each, 1,200 total"}]}]}, {"name": "Protection", "properties": [{"name": "Active Protection System", "value": "No"}, {"name": "NBC Protection", "value": "INA"}]}], "type": "WEG", "version": 1}, "images": [{"name": "LCM8MIKE(A).JPG", "url": "/mediawiki/images/f/f4/LCM8MIKE%28A%29.JPG"}, {"name": "LCM8MIKE(B).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/b/b7/LCM8MIKE%28B%29.jpg"}, {"name": "LCM8MIKE(C).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/2/29/LCM8MIKE%28C%29.jpg"}], "categories": ["WEG", "Naval Watercraft", "Landing Ships and Amphibious Assault Ships", "United States", "PRO_Australia", "PRO_Cambodia", "PRO_France", "PRO_India", "PRO_Laos (People's Democratic Republic)", "PRO_South Korea (Republic of Korea)", "PRO_Thailand", "PRO_Tonga", "PRO_Turkey", "PRO_United States of America", "PRO_Viet Nam", "Sea", "Tier4"]}, {"title": "Zodiac FC470 American Inflatable Boat (RIB)", "id": 8128, "json": {"tiers": [false, true, false, false], "notes": "The Zodiac MILPRO FC 470 Professional is directed towards the military and professional user who doesn't need all of the features that the standard model has for mission or delivery method requirements.

The submarine is named after the city of Severodvinsk.\n\nThe Yasen class, Russian designations Project 885 Yasen and Project 885M Yasen-M (Russian: \u042f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c, lit. 'ash tree', NATO reporting name: Yasen), also referred to as Graney class, are series of newest nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines designed by Malakhit and being constructed by Sevmash for the Russian Navy. Based on the Akula class and Alfa class designs, the Yasen class is projected to replace the Russian Navy's current Soviet-era nuclear attack submarines.\n\nThe vessel's design is claimed to be state-of-the-art. The Yasen-class nuclear submarines are presumed to be armed with land-attack cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, anti-submarine missiles including the P-800 Oniks SLCM, Kalibr family SLCM or 3M51 SLCM. Kalibr-PL has several variants including the 3M54K (terminal-supersonic) and 3M54K1 (subsonic) anti-ship, 91R1 anti-submarine, and the 3M14K land-attack variant. In the future, there will be also an option to install the hypersonic 3M22 Zircon cruise missiles on upgraded 855M boats. Each submarine can carry 32 Kalibr or 24 Oniks (other sources claim 40 Kalibr and 32 Oniks) cruise missiles which are stored in eight (ten for 855M) vertical launchers (additional missiles may be carried in the torpedo room at the expense of torpedoes). It will also have ten 533 mm tubes, as well as mines and anti-submarine missiles such as the RPK-7.\n\nIt is the first Russian submarine class to be equipped with a spherical sonar, designated as MGK-600 Irtysh-Amfora. The device (allegedly the Irtysh/Amfora sonar system) was tested on a modified Yankee-class submarine. The sonar system consists of a spherical bow array, flank arrays, and a towed array. Due to the large size of this spherical array, the torpedo tubes are slanted. In other words, the torpedo tube outer doors are not located in the immediate bow as in the previous Akula class but moved aft. The hull is constructed from low-magnetic steel. Unlike previous Russian submarines which have a double hull, Yasen-class submarines mostly have a single hull. The Yasen class has a crew of 85 on project 885 and 64 on project 885M, suggesting a high degree of automation in the submarine's different systems. The newest U.S. Virginia-class submarines have a crew of 134 in comparison.\n\nYasen-class submarines are the first to be equipped with a fourth-generation nuclear reactor. The reactor, built by Afrikantov OKBM, will allegedly have a 25-30 year core life and will not have to be refueled. Steam turbines are supplied by Kaluga Turbine Works. The inclusion of a new generation KTP-6 reactor on the Yasen-M boats is thought to significantly reduce their noise level: the reactor's primary cooling loop facilitates the natural circulation of water and thus doesn't require continuous operation of the main circulation pumps, which are the key noise factor on a nuclear submarine. The only other submarine classes in service with such reactor design are USN' Ohio and Virginia, employing the S8G and S9G reactors respectively.\n\nA VSK rescue pod is carried in the sail.\n\nAccording to admiral Foggo, the commander of the US Naval Forces Europe, the Yasen class submarines are \"very quiet, which is the most important thing in submarine warfare\". It's claimed that Severodvinsk is far quieter than previous Russian SSNs, capable of 20 knots while running quiet, which is equal to the Seawolf-class and inferior only to Virginia (25 knots).

Development began in 1972 at the Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering.[citation needed] The submarine was the first that could launch any number of missiles in a single salvo, also the first submarine capable of carrying ballistic missiles with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles.

A hydroacoustic navigational system called Shme\u013e (Bumblebee) allows the submarine to determine its position from hydroacoustic buoys. \n\nOn 30 September 2008, a Russian Navy spokesman reported that Ryazan had successfully completed a 30-day transit from a base in northern Russia under the Arctic ice cap to a base on the Kamchatka Peninsula.

The Project 945A has a considerably larger sail which is 5 m (16.4 ft) longer than the Sierra I class. The sail also has a curiously flat, square leading edge. The masts are offset on the starboard side to make way for two escape pods in the sail. The starboard side also has a 10-point environment sensor fitted at right angles to the front end of the sail. Also, the Sierra II class has a much larger pod on its after fin. The pod houses the Skat 3 passive very low frequency towed sonar array.\n\nTwo titanium-hulled SIERRA-II nuclear-powered attack submarines serve with Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet stationed near the Arctic Circle. The last Titanium-Hulled attack submarines completed, represent a premium design compared to the more numerous AKULA Class.\n\nThe first of the original Project-945 SIERRA-I Class boats were laid down in 1979 and joined the Navy in 1984. Two SIERRA-Is were joined by two of the improved Project-945A SIERRA-II Class in 1986 and 1989. A single further improved Project-945AB SIERRA-III was laid down but abandoned at the end of the Cold War. Compared to the SIERRA-I, the -II model featured an enlarged sail with two rather than one escape pod in it. One of the pods is offset to port and the other to starboard. A more subtle improvement is an enlarged main sonar, the same MGK-501 Skat passive array fitted to the larger AKULA Class. The increased size of the sonar means that the large-diameter 650mm torpedo tubes had to be replaced by regular 533mm tubes.\n\nLike most modern SSNs the class is covered in sonar absorbing Anechoic tiles. These often fall off creating a pockmarked surface and disheveled appearance. The SIERRAs suffer from this more than most other classes, possibly due to difficulty attaching the tiles to the titanium hull.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1988, "countryOfOrigin": "Russia (RUS)", "proliferation": "Russian Federation", "selectedregions": ["All Regions"], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Russian Federation"], "dis": {"name": "SSN SIERRA II PROJECT 945B CLASS", "string": "01.04.222.003.005.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Sierra II Class; Project 945A Kondor Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarine"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Krasnoye Sormovo Zavod 112, Nizhniy Novogord, Russia"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "Total 61 (31 off. + 30 enl.)"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "110.5 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "14.2 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "8.8 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Surface", "value": "7,722 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Submerged", "value": "9,246 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "1 x VM-5"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "Pressurized-water nuclear reactor"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "48,000 total shp"}, {"name": "Auxiliary Power", "value": "2 x 496 shp auxiliary propulsion motors; 2 x 185 shp retractable electric maneuvering propulsors"}, {"name": "Maximum Surface Speed", "value": "10 knots"}, {"name": "Maximum Submerged Speed", "value": "32 knots"}]}, {"name": "Communication", "properties": [{"name": "Communications Suite", "value": "The class is fitted with the Omnibus combat system, Molnaya-MTs communications suite and the Symfoniya navigation suite."}]}, {"name": "Missile Weapon System", "sections": [{"name": "Missile #1", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "SS-N-21 Sampson Cruise Missile"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Sea-Launched Cruise Missile"}, {"name": "Manufacturer", "value": "Novator Design Bureau, Yekaterinburg, Russia\n Raduga Mechanical Design Bureau, Russia"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "8.1 m"}, {"name": "Diameter", "value": "510 mm"}, {"name": "Wingspan", "value": "3.3 m"}, {"name": "Launch Weight", "value": "1,700 kg"}, {"name": "Engine", "value": "turbofan w/solid-fuel booster"}, {"name": "Warhead", "value": "200 kt nuclear; or 400 kg high-explosive or submunitions"}, {"name": "Guidance System", "value": "Sprut inertial with terrain contour matching homing"}, {"name": "Radar", "value": "Teraprom active"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "390 knots (720 km/h)"}, {"name": "Range", "value": "2,400 km"}, {"name": "Circular Error Probable", "value": "150 m"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "40 x SS-N-21 Sampson Cruise Missile"}]}, {"name": "Missile #2", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "1 x Man-portable SAM system"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Strela-2M missiles"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "1.44 m"}, {"name": "Diameter", "value": "72 mm"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "9.8 kg"}, {"name": "Wingspan", "value": "0.3 m"}, {"name": "Warhead", "value": "1.15 kg directed-energy blast fragmentation warhead"}, {"name": "Guidance System", "value": "Proportional navigation logic"}, {"name": "Detonation Mechanism", "value": "Non-delay impact and grazing fuzes, 14\u201317 second delay self-destruct."}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "430 m/s"}, {"name": "Flight Altitude", "value": "50\u20132300 m"}, {"name": "Range", "value": "4,200 m"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "12 x Strela-2M missiles"}]}]}, {"name": "Torpedo System", "properties": [{"name": "Torpedo Launcher", "value": "6 x 533-mm bow"}, {"name": "Torpedo Name", "value": "USET-80 torpedo"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "40 x  USET-80 torpedoes carried]"}]}, {"name": "Mine System", "properties": [{"name": "Note", "value": "42 x mines max in lieu of torpedoes and/or other weapons"}]}, {"name": "Radar Systems", "properties": [{"name": "Surface Search / Navigation Radar", "value": "1 x MRK-50 Albatros' series (Snoop Pair) surface search/navigation"}]}, {"name": "Sonar Systems", "properties": [{"name": "Passive Flank Array Sonar", "value": "1 x MGK-540 Skat-3 (Shark Gill) low frequency suite that includes Shark Rib passive flank arrays"}, {"name": "Mine-Avoidance Sonar", "value": "1 x MG-519 (Mouse Roar) active high-frequency mine-avoidance system"}, {"name": "Towed Passive Array Sonar", "value": "1 x large aperture towed passive hydrophone array"}]}, {"name": "Protection", "properties": [{"name": "Hull Armor", "value": "The Project 945A nuclear-powered submarine is the sole submarine in the world with a titanium hull, which reduces its radar signature considerably.

The conning tower has an aerodynamic design and houses an escape pod for all its crew members. Noise reduction has been a key element in the design. The floors are suspended within the hull and anechoic tiles cover the external hull. The Akula is reported to be nearly as silent as the original US Los Angeles class.

The first ship of the class, Ivan Gren, was laid down on 23 December 2004. The hull of Ivan Gren was completed by the end of November 2010. On 9 October 2010 a contract to increase work on the vessel was signed. The ship was launched on 18 May 2012 and was scheduled to be delivered to the Russian Navy by 2014. Delivery of Ivan Gren was delayed until 2015 while the second ship of the class, Pyotr Morgunov, was laid down in October 2014. Ivan Gren started its sea trials in June 2016 in the Baltic Sea. According to Russian sources, the delay in commissioning of the lead ship was due to several design faults that include hull stability and engine problems.\n\nOn 3 May 2018, the lead ship of the class, Ivan Gren, successfully completed its sea trials held in the Baltic Sea. The warship's systems and complexes were checked by the state acceptance commission of Russia's Defense Ministry. Ivan Gren was accepted into service on 20 June 2018.\n\nInitially, there were no plans to build more ships following Pyotr Morgunov. However, in December 2018, it was reported by the head of Russia's United Shipbuilding Corporation that Russia plans to order additional two or three modified Ivan Gren-class landing ships. On 9 April 2019, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu announced two more Project 11711 landing ships will be laid down on 23 April 2019.\n\nOn 23 April 2019, two modified Project 11711 landing ships, Vladimir Andreev and Vasily Trushin, were laid down during a ceremony at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad.

The class was designed by the Severnoye Design Bureau and incorporates the use of stealth technology. So far, six vessels of the class have been ordered and scheduled for delivery by 2025. The lead ship of the class, Admiral Gorshkov, was commissioned on 28 July 2018.\n\n The Admiral Gorshkov is a new Russian class of multi-role frigates. It is a successor to the Burevestnik class (Western reporting name Krivak class). The project was approved by the Russian Naval Command in 2003. Construction of the lead ship, Admiral Gorshkov, started in 2006. It was commissioned with the Russian Navy in 2018. By 2018 another 3 frigates of the class were under construction, plus 2 more were ordered and 2 more were planned. The Russian Navy has a requirement for 20-30 of such new frigates to fully replace the surviving Krivak class frigates and Sovremenny class destroyers. It is planned that Admiral Gorshkov class frigates will become the mainstay of the future Russian fleet. An export version of this frigate class is also being proposed for possible customers.\n\n   The Admiral Gorshkov class is a perfect example of a multi-role frigate. Many other frigates are focused on specific tasks, such as anti-air warfare, or anti-submarine warfare. This Russian frigate was designed to perform multiple roles, such as perform long-range attacks against surface targets and ships, conduct anti-submarine warfare, carry out escort missions, and be deployed in a variety of situations that a general frigate class would not be able to fulfill. In some cases, such multi-role frigates can even substitute the deployment of larger destroyers.\n\n   This new class of Russian frigates incorporates the best weapons and sensors that the Russian industry can produce.\n\n   The Admiral Gorshkov class is equipped with a 16-cell Vertical Launch System (VLS) for a mix of Kalibr-NK land-attack cruise missiles (range 2 500 km), P-800 Oniks anti-ship missiles (range 300-500 km), and 91RTE2 anti-submarine missiles (missile drops torpedo 50 km away).\n\n   There is another 32-cell VLS for medium-range air defense missiles. It uses the same 9M96E and 9M96E2 interceptor missiles as the S-400 land-based air defense system. These missiles are intended to defend against precision attacks and various defense suppression weapons. These missiles are designed for direct impact to have a range of 40 and 120 km respectively. Their claimed kill probability is 90% against aircraft and 70% against Harpoon anti-ship missile. It has been reported that this vertical launch system can also launch a short-range missile which is likely a variant of the 9M100.\n\nFurther anti-submarine/anti-shipping capabilities are provided via two quadruple 330 mm torpedo launchers for unique Paket-NK torpedoes. These can engage both enemy submarines, as well as incoming torpedoes, thus serving a dual role.\n\n   There is a 130 mm A-192M gun. It has a rate of fire of 45 rounds per minute. It can be used to engage surface targets, as well as to bombard land. Last-ditch defense is provided by two Palash Close-In Weapon Systems (CIWS), mounted at the rear. These defense systems are fitted with 30 mm rapid-firing Gatling guns and 8 short-range surface-to-air missiles each. Also, there are two pedestal-mounted 14.5 mm heavy machine guns.\n\n   The Admiral Gorshkov class frigates have a hangar and can accommodate a single Kamov Ka-27, or similar naval helicopter.\n\n   The Admiral Gorshkov class has a Combined Diesel and Gas (CODAG) propulsion. Machinery includes two cruise diesel engines, developing a combined output of 10 400 shp and two boost gas turbines, developing a combined output of 55 000 shp. The power is delivered to 2 shafts. The maximum speed is 29.5 knots (55 km/h).\n\n   However, construction of the third and fourth ships was postponed due to problems with the engine supply. The first two ships of the Admiral Gorshkov class have Ukrainian gas turbine engines. A center of Soviet maritime gas turbine design and production was in Ukraine. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia used to purchase these engines from Ukraine. However, following the 2014 Russian military aggression in Ukraine, the Ukrainians refused to supply Russia with military technology. In 2014 one gas turbine engine of the second ship, Admiral Kasatonov was transferred to the lead ship, Admiral Gorshkov, in order to complete it.\n\n   The Russian NPO Saturn has been commissioned to design new engines for the Admiral Gorshkov class frigates, allowing the third and fourth ship to be commissioned from 2020.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2015, "countryOfOrigin": "Russia (RUS)", "proliferation": "Russian Federation", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Russian Federation"], "dis": {"name": "FFG 417 ADMIRAL GORSHKOV", "string": "01.03.222.006.014.001.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative designations", "value": "Admiral Gorshkov Class;

The small size of the ship, along with some stealth features provides it with good protection against enemy detection, and it can be armed with a variety of light anti-ship missiles. In addition to the low radar cross-section, the boat is also extremely fast with an aluminum monohull with stepped planning.\n\nThe catamaran design also provides better seaworthiness in comparison to the other boats of similar displacement with a conventional hull. The missile boats have been exported to Iran, where since 2000 it has been in service with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy Corps. In Chinese service, it primarily serves as a trial boat, including testing various light anti-ship missiles and other weaponry for catamarans.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Chinese Navy started two indigenous fast-attack craft programs, while also considering the acquisition of a Russian-built fast-attack craft. The China Cat-class 20-ton missile boat was developed for use in the Middle East but was also to be built for Chinese naval service.\n\nIn 2002 the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) demonstrated the \"China Cat\" high-speed boat prototype, for which Iran was the first customer. This ship uses the catamaran hull, 23 meters long, with a waterline length of 14 meters. Powered by two diesel engines, the maximum speed was approximately 50 knots.\n\nThe Cat has a lightweight search radar in the mast crown, a photoelectric surveillance installment in the mast substructure platform. It was not initially clear which model missile would be carried, possibly the short-range C-701 guided missile, which the China National Precision Machinery Import & Export Corporation CMPIEC developed. CMPIEC had already completed the shipborne C-701 testing by 2000. Providing the equipment for the fast assault boat was a way to push this guided missile to exports the market. The boats delivered to Iran were equipped with this missile.\n\nIn May 2002 it was reported that China had sold Iran high-speed catamaran missile patrol boats. The first of the new C-14 patrol boats was reportedly observed by US military intelligence in an Iranian port. A Chinese delegation of technicians was in Iran to help the Iranian navy train and equip the new boats.

The CRRC can be inflated in minutes by foot pump, compressor or CO2 tank and can be deployed from shore and a variety of vessels. Additionally, it can be launched from several types of aircraft and submarines equipped with a special lockout chamber or a Dry Deck Shelter. Its chief advantages are light weight, compact size when stowed, stealth, versatility, and the safety imparted by its super-buoyant nature (which gives it the ability to operate in relatively high seas).\n\nA total of six individual airtight chambers comprise the Wing P4.7. The main hull or gunwale contains five intercommunicating chambers, which are separated by internal baffles and valves. This means that a single leak will not result in loss of pressure throughout the boat, and that air can be bled between chambers to compensate for loss in one. The final chamber is an inflatable keel tube which runs the length of the craft and gives the bottom of the hull a \"V\" shape, imparting directional stability and additional shock absorption. A composite decay proof \"transom\" board at the stern provides a mounting point for the outboard engine(s) . The deck (floor) is composed of four interlocking composite plates, which are fixed to the \"thrust board\" at the bow end and the transom at the stern. This rigid structure, spanning the entire internal area of the boat, prevents the hull from collapsing or \"taco-ing\" under power.\n\n\nU.S. Marines from the Battalion Landing Team 2/2 go ashore in a CRRC during a 2003 exercise.\nA ready-for-use craft includes an outboard engine (two in some configurations); removable composite deckplates or roll-up slatted decking; paddles; a bow line for securing the docked boat and a \"righting\" line which is used to flip the boat in the event of capsizing. At the bow of the boat are storage bags for equipment (foot pumps, extra lines, etc.) and a special fuel bladder, which can be of either 6- or 18-gallon capacity and which feeds the engine via a flexible hose. Deflated and rolled up, the boat and all necessary equipment can easily fit into the bed of a small pickup. Most military CRRC's use a 55 horsepower (41 kW) two-stroke engine with a pumpjet propulsor, which consists of a shrouded impeller.[4] This design reduces the risk of serious injury to personnel in the water when compared to the traditional open propeller. It also reduces the risk of the propulsion system being seriously damaged by submerged objects.\n\nA specially-trained coxswain sits at the stern (rear) of the boat and controls it via the tiller arm, attached to an outboard engine. The coxswain is considered the commander of the craft and is ultimately responsible for its operation, regardless of whether a senior-ranking individual is on board. Across from him sits the assistant coxswain, who relays hand signals from other boats and aids the coxswain as required. The remaining passengers (six raiders plus the two coxswains make up a full team) normally lay on and straddle the gunwale, keeping a low silhouette to help avoid detection and leaving room on the deck for weapons, equipment and (if necessary) additional fuel bladders.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2007, "countryOfOrigin": "United States", "proliferation": "United States of America", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["United States of America"], "dis": {"name": "Unknown", "string": "00.00.000.000.000.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "F470 Zodiac"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC)"}, {"name": "Family", "value": "Zodiac"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "1", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Troop Compartment Capacity", "value": "10", "units": "ea"}, {"name": "Skin Type", "value": "Tear-Resistant Duratane Skin for heavy duty abuse"}, {"name": "Time to Inflate", "value": "2", "units": "min"}, {"name": "Number of Chambers", "value": "8", "units": "ea"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "4.75", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Width", "value": "1.89", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Height", "value": "0.61", "units": "m"}, {"name": "Weight, Empty", "value": "146", "units": "kg"}, {"name": "Displacement (Surface)", "value": "", "units": "tons"}, {"name": "Stowed Foorprint", "value": "2 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft. 11 in."}]}, {"name": "Automotive", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "1 x OUtboard 2 or 4 stroke Engine with pump jet propulsion"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "55", "units": "hp"}, {"name": "Cruising Range", "value": "varies depending on fuel load and payload"}, {"name": "Speed, Surface", "value": "18", "units": "kts"}, {"name": "Propeller", "value": "Shrouded Impeller"}, {"name": "Maximum Payload, inlcuding fuel", "value": "1,250", "units": "kg"}]}], "type": "WEG", "version": 1}, "images": [{"name": "F470_(A).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/b/b9/F470_%28A%29.jpg"}, {"name": "F470_(B).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/0/0b/F470_%28B%29.jpg"}, {"name": "F470_(C).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/f/f5/F470_%28C%29.jpg"}], "categories": ["WEG", "Naval Watercraft", "Small Boats", "United States", "PRO_United States of America", "Sea", "Tier2"]}, {"title": "BK-16 Raptor Class Russian Fast Attack Craft", "id": 5902, "json": {"tiers": [true, false, false, false], "notes": "Russia`s Kalashnikov Group has developed a new fast attack craft (FAC).

It is intended to replace the Rubis-class submarines. Construction began in 2007 and the first unit will be commissioned in 2020.\n\nIn October 1998, the Delegation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour l'Armement, the French government's defense procurement agency, established an integrated project team consisting of the Naval Staff, DCN (now known as Naval Group), Technicatome and the Commissariat a l'\u00c9nergie Atomique, a regulatory body that oversees nuclear power plants, to oversee the design of a new attack submarine class. DCN was to be the boat's designer and builder while Technicatome (since acquired by Areva) was to be responsible for the nuclear power plant. The two companies were to act jointly as a single prime contractor to share the industrial risks, manage the schedules, and be responsible for the design's performance and costs, which at the time was estimated to be US$4.9 billion.\n\nOn 22 December 2006, the French government placed a \u20ac7.9 billion order for six Barracuda submarines with Naval Group and their nuclear power plants with Areva-Technicatome. According to the DGA \u201cCompetition at the subcontractor level will be open to foreign companies for the first time.\u201dAccording to the contract, the first boat was to commence sea trials in early 2016, with delivery occurring in late 2016/early 2017. This was to be followed by entry into service in late 2017.\n\nNaval Group also designed a conventionally powered derivative, dubbed the SMX-Ocean, featuring fuel cells and vertical launchers. Another conventionally powered design, the Shortfin Barracuda, was selected as a future replacement for the Collins-class vessels with the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nIn 2016, Naval Group also began to position itself and its Shortfin Barracuda design to the Royal Canadian Navy's Future Canadian Submarines project. The project is planned to replace the Victoria-class submarines by 2030.\n\nNaval Group is also offering a version of the \"Shortfin\" diesel-electric variant as replacement for the current Walrus-class submarines of the Royal Netherlands Navy competing against the A26 design by Saab and Damen.\n\nBarracudas will use technology from the Triomphant class, including pump-jet propulsion. This class reportedly produces approximately 1/1000 of the detectable noise of the Redoutable-class boats (submarines), and they are ten times more sensitive in detecting other submarines. They will be fitted with torpedo-tube-launched cruise missiles MDCN SCALP Naval for long-range (well above 1,000 km, 620 mi) strikes against strategic land targets. Their missions will include anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare, land attack, intelligence gathering, crisis management and special operations.\n\nThe Barracuda class nuclear reactor incorporates several improvements over that of the preceding Rubis. Notably, it extends the time between refueling and complex overhauls (RCOHs) from 7 to 10 years, enabling higher at-sea availability.\n\nIn support of special operations missions, Barracudas may also accommodate up to 12 commandos, while carrying their equipment in a mobile pod attached aft of the sail.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2020, "countryOfOrigin": "France", "proliferation": "France", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["France"], "dis": {"name": "SSN SUFFREN BARRACUDA CLASS", "string": "01.04.071.003.002.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Suffren Class; Barracuda Class"}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "Ships Planned: 6\nShips Completed: 1"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Nuclear Attack Submarine"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Naval Group (formerly known as DCNS and DCN)"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "60 (8 off. + 52 enl.) + 10 special forces"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "99.5 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "8.8 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "7.3 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Surface", "value": "4,680 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Submerged", "value": "5,300 tons"}, {"name": "Draught", "value": "7.3 m"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "1 x modified K-15 pressurized water reactor."}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "41,500 total shp"}, {"name": "Auxiliary Propulsion", "value": "2 x SEMT-Pielstick 8 PA4 V200 diesel generator sets; 1,225 total bhp"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "Unlimited range, 10 years (nuclear fuel)"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed, Surface", "value": "14 knots"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed, Submerged", "value": "25 knots"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "70 days"}]}, {"name": "Main Armament", "sections": [{"name": "Anti-Ship Missile (Option 1)", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "SM 39 Exocet"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Anti-Ship Cruise Missile"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "1974-Present"}, {"name": "Proliferation", "value": "India                \n France\n Pakistan"}, {"name": "Manufacturer", "value": "1979\u20131999: A\u00e9rospatiale\n1999\u20132001: A\u00e9rospatiale-Matra\n2001\u2013present: MBDA"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "5.80 m"}, {"name": "Diameter", "value": "348 mm"}, {"name": "Wingspan", "value": "1.14 m"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "666 kg"}, {"name": "Configuration", "value": "slim, pointed cylinder cruciform cropped and swept delta mainplanes indexed in-line with small cruciform tail planes"}, {"name": "Propulsion", "value": "2 x SNPE double-base Nitramite smokeless solid-propellant rockets.\n1 x Epervier booster with 2.4 sec burn.\n1 x Eole V sustainer with 200-220 sec burn"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "594 kt (684 mph; 1,100 km/h) or Mach 0.93"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "50 km"}, {"name": "Minimum Range", "value": "4 km"}, {"name": "Peak Altitude", "value": "50 m"}, {"name": "Warhead", "value": "363 lb.

Moskva is armed with P-1000 Vulkan AShM missiles, developed in the late 1970s to late 1980s. It is not known which Slava-class cruisers carry P-1000s other than Moskva. There was a long delay in this program, while the problems with the Bazalt were resolved. These ships acted as flagships for numerous task forces. All ships were built at the 61 Kommunar yard, in Mykolaiv (Nikolaev), Ukrainian SSR. The class was a follow-up to the Kara-class cruiser which the Soviet Navy typed as a Large Anti-submarine Ship (Russ. BPK), constructed at the same shipyard and appears to be built on a stretched version of the Kara-class hull.\n\nThe Slava class was initially designated BLACKCOM 1 (Black Sea Combatant 1) and then designated the Krasina class for a short period until Slava was observed at sea. The SS-N-12 launchers are fixed facing forward at around 8\u00b0 elevation with no reloads available. As there was nothing revolutionary about the design of the class western observers felt they were created as a hedge against the failure of the more radical Kirov class. The helicopter hangar deck is located 1/2 deck below the landing pad with a ramp connecting the two.\n\nOriginally 10 ships were planned, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union, only three were completed. A fourth vessel was launched, but final construction remains incomplete and the ship has not been commissioned into service.\n\nFollowing the collapse and the re-emergence of the nation of Russia, the three finished ships serve in the Russian Navy and the uncompleted fourth vessel renamed Ukrayina, is owned by Ukraine. Efforts have been made to complete and update the unfinished ship; in 2010, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych stated that Russia and Ukraine would work together on the project. Russia has also expressed interest in purchasing the vessel, which Ukraine had previously offered for sale.

Planning for ships to replace the Adelaide-class frigates and restore the capability last exhibited by the Perth-class destroyers began by 2000, initially under acquisition project SEA 1400, which was re-designated SEA 4000. Although the designation \"Air Warfare Destroyer\" is used to describe ships dedicated to the defence of a naval force (plus assets ashore) from aircraft and missile attack, the planned Australian destroyers are expected to also operate in anti-surface, anti-submarine, and naval gunfire support roles.\n\nPlanning for the Australian Air Warfare Destroyer (as the class was known until 2006) continued through the mid-2000s, with the selection of the Aegis combat system as the intended combat system and ASC as the primary shipbuilder in 2005. In late 2005, the AWD Alliance was formed as a consortium of the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO), ASC, and Raytheon. Between 2005 and 2007, Gibbs & Cox's Evolved Arleigh Burke-class destroyer concept and Navantia's \u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n-class frigate competed for selection as the AWD design. Although the Arleigh Burke design was larger and more capable, the \u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n design was selected in June 2007 as it was an existing design, and would be cheaper, quicker, and less risky to build.\n\nThree ships were ordered in October 2007, and will be assembled at ASC's facility in Osborne, South Australia, from 31 pre-fabricated modules (or 'blocks'). An option to build a fourth destroyer was included in the original contract, but has not been exercised. ASC, NQEA Australia, and the Forgacs Group were selected in May 2009 to build the blocks, but within two months, NQEA was replaced by BAE Systems Australia. Construction errors and growing delays led the AWD Alliance to redistribute the construction workload in 2011, with some modules to be built by Navantia. Increasing slippage has pushed the original planned 2014-2016 commissioning dates out by at least three years, with lead ship Hobart to be completed by June 2017, Brisbane in September 2018, and Sydney by March 2020. The AWD Alliance, Navantia, and the involved shipyards have been criticised for underestimating risks, costs, and timeframes; faulty drawings and bad building practices leading to repeated manufacturing errors; and blame-passing. The alliance concept has been panned for having no clear management structure or entity in charge, and having the DMO simultaneously acting as supplier, build partner, and customer for the ships.\n\n\nEach destroyer will have a length overall of 147.2 metres (483 ft), a maximum beam of 18.6 metres (61 ft), and a draught of 5.17 metres (17.0 ft). At launch, the ships will have a full-load displacement of 6,250 tonnes (6,150 long tons; 6,890 short tons). The Hobarts have been designed to allow for upgrades and installation of new equipment, with a theoretical maximum displacement of 7,000 tonnes (6,900 long tons; 7,700 short tons).\n\nThe Hobarts use a more powerful propulsion system than their Spanish predecessors. The combined diesel or gas turbine (CODOG) propulsion arrangement consists of two General Electric Marine model 7LM2500-SA-MLG38 gas turbines, each generating 17,500 kilowatts (23,500 hp), and two Caterpillar Bravo 16 V Bravo diesel engines, each providing 5,650 kilowatts (7,580 hp).[4] These drive two propeller shafts, fitted with W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 controllable pitch propellers. The ships' maximum speed is over 28 knots (52 km/h; 32 mph), with a range of over 5,000 nautical miles (9,300 km; 5,800 mi) at 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph); although not fast enough to keep pace with an American carrier battle group, the RAN is happy with the speed/range tradeoff, as endurance is more important for Australian operating conditions. For in-harbour manoeuvring, each destroyer is fitted with a bow thruster.\n\nThe standard ship's company is 186-strong, plus 16 additional personnel to operate and maintain the ship's helicopter.

It consists of only one ship, DD-167 Shenzhen. When Shenzhen was commissioned into the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force in 1998, it was then, the largest surface combatant that China had ever built. It resembles in many ways an enlarged version of the Luhu-class destroyer, and is one of the first PLAN ships with a slope-sided hull to reduce radar signature. The 051B was succeeded by the domestic Type 052B, discounting the 4 Soviet built Sovremennyy-class destroyer China purchased in the interim.\n\nShenzhen was laid down by the Dalian Shipyard in May 1996. The Shenzhen was intended to be an experimental vessel with improvements over the Luhu-class' in terms of modular construction and stealth. The ship is powered by two indigenous steam turbine engines, due to Dalian Shipyard's experience in steam turbine construction and that Chinese domestic research and development on marine gas turbines had not yet matured. The displacement of the Luhai-class is 2,000 tons heavier than the Type 052 destroyer, Luhu-class. Shenzhen was launched in 1997, although official revelation of the ship's existence did not come until the year following its commissioning. The chief designer of this class is academic, Mr. Pan Jingfu (\u6f58\u955c\u8299), who is also the designer of both the Type 051B's predecessor and successor.\n\nThe main purpose of the Type 051B was to gain experience in modern naval ship design and construction, and refining the knowledge and skills accumulated from the earlier Type 052, such as integrating many different foreign subsystems on the Type 052 more effectively. The ship is powered by steam turbines due to the 1989 western arms embargo and that domestic gas turbines were not ready in time. The Type 051B also employed stealth construction techniques which resulted in a smaller radar cross section in comparison to its predecessor. Analysts speculated that the ship would have been equipped with an VLS system in the forward section for air-defense SAMs. However, when the ship was finally revealed, it was still armed with the 8-cell HQ-7 SAM launcher. These SAMs lack effectiveness against sea skimming missiles with multiple approaching angles. The PLAN was unsatisfied with the design and no further ships of the class were built. At the time, area air defence for the fleet was the PLAN's priority which older systems couldn't sufficiently provide, and since the capability couldn't be served by the final vessel the gap remained open. As a result, the decision to import two pairs of Sovremennyy-class destroyer from Russia was determined to fulfil the role. However, Type 051B does have an advantage over earlier Chinese principle surface combatants and Russian ships in that it is the first Chinese naval ship to be equipped with fleet formation command and control system so it can act as a flagship of the fleet. \n\nThe sole Type 051B destroyer 167 Shenzhen participated in the PLA Navy's first goodwill visit to Africa in 2000, the first visit to Europe in 2001 and the first visit to Japan in 2007. In 2004, the ship received its mid-life modernization refit, with its original 100mm main gun and the HQ-7 air defense missile system being replaced by improved models.\n\nType 051B destroyer 167 Shenzhen visited Kochi, India for four days in August 2009, after deployment in the Gulf of Aden on anti-piracy operations.\n\n2015 Refit and upgrades:\nIn early 2015, the sole Type 051B destroyer was spotted at the Zhanjiang naval base undergoing work. Initially it was unclear whether this was due to a midlife refit program or decommissioning, but pictures revealed in January 2016 that the ship was being refitted with new systems. For self-defense, the four old Type 76A 37 mm AA guns were replaced with two H/PJ-11 eleven-barreled 30 mm CIWS (export designation Type 1130), one covering each side.\n\nAnti-aircraft defense is upgraded from the 8-unit HQ-7 with a 10\u201315 km (6.2\u20139.3 mi) range to a 32-cell vertical launch system (VLS) in front of the superstructure for 50\u201360 km (31\u201337 mi)-ranged HQ-16s, directed by four Type 345 (Front-Dome type) illuminators, increasing SAM coverage by 16 times. The helicopter hangar was modified to carry a single Ka-28 ASW helicopter in place of the original dual Z-9 hangar, and two new mast structures were fitted; a Type 382 Radar on the forward mast and a Type 364 targeting radar (under dome) on the aft mast. The upgrades give the Type 051B weapon and sensor capabilities similar to the Type 054A frigate. The Type 382 replaced the Type 381 singe-faced phased-array radar, and moved from the aft to the forward mast to remove the blind arc it previously exhibited, the quarterdeck was fully enclosed, and new apertures were added in the transom indicating that torpedo decoy and towed array sonar systems have been added; a variable depth sonar has not been installed. The ship completed the weapon systems upgrade in August 2016.\n\nIn May 2020, it was revealed that the Type 051B had its YJ-83 subsonic ASMs replaced with 16 supersonic YJ-12 missiles.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1999, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "DDG LUHAI TYPE 051B CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.004.003.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 051B; Luhai Class"}, {"name": "Date of Introduction", "value": "1999"}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "1 vessel of this class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Destroyer"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "1999-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "250 (40 officers)"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "155 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "17.2 m"}, {"name": "Draught", "value": "6 m"}, {"name": "Displacement", "value": "6,100 tonnes (6,000 long tons; 6,700 short tons) tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "2 Steam turbines"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "94,000 shp (70,100 kW)"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "14,000 miles (23,000 km)"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "31 knots (57 km/h; 36 mph)"}, {"name": "Endurance", "value": "INA"}]}, {"name": "Communications", "properties": [{"name": "Information Processing System", "value": "Information processing system designed by the 709th Institute (Reported speed: 10 Mbit/s)"}, {"name": "Data Link", "value": "Data link: HN-900 (Chinese equivalent of Link 11 A/B, to be upgraded)"}, {"name": "Communications", "value": "SNTI-240 SATCOM"}]}, {"name": "Missile Weapon System", "sections": [{"name": "Missile Weapon System #1", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "YJ-83"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Anti-Ship Missile"}, {"name": "Launcher", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Diameter", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Engine", "value": "CTJ-2 turbojet"}, {"name": "Warhead", "value": "190 kg high-explosive fragmentation"}, {"name": "Operational Range", "value": "180 km"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "Mach 0.9"}, {"name": "Guidance System", "value": "Inertial navigation/active radar homing terminal guidance"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "16"}]}, {"name": "Missile Weapon System #2", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "HQ-16"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Surface-to-Air Missile"}, {"name": "Launcher", "value": "Vertical Launch System (VLS)"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Diamter", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Operational Range", "value": "40 km"}, {"name": "Speed", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "HQ-16 (Hongqi-16) - Co-developed by China and Russia,believed to be based on either the SA-11 or SA-17.Credited with a range of 40 km.

During the 1980s, the RAN began plans to replace the River-class destroyer escorts (based on the British Leander Class) with a mid-capability patrol frigate, and settled on the idea of modifying a proven foreign design for Australian conditions. Around the same time, the RNZN was seeking to replace their Leander-class frigates while maintaining blue-water capabilities. A souring of relations between New Zealand and the United States of America in relation to New Zealand's nuclear-free zone and the ANZUS security treaty prompted New Zealand to seek improved ties with other nations, particularly Australia. As both nations were seeking warships of similar capabilities, the decision was made in 1987 to collaborate on their acquisition. The project name (and later, the class name) is taken from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps of the First World War.\n\nTwelve ship designs were tendered in 1986. By 1989, the project had selected a proposal by Germany's Blohm + Voss, based on their MEKO 200 design, to be built in Australia by AMECON at Williamstown, Victoria. The modular design of the frigates allowed sections to be constructed at Whangarei, New Zealand and Newcastle, New South Wales in addition to Williamstown. The RAN ordered eight ships, while the RNZN ordered two and had the option to add two more. The frigate acquisition was controversial and widely opposed in New Zealand, and as a result, the additional ships were not ordered.\n\nIn 1992, work started on the frigates; 3,600-tonne (3,500-long-ton) ships capable of a 27-knot (50 km/h; 31 mph) top speed, and a range of 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km; 6,900 mi) at 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph). The armament initially consisted of a single 5-inch gun and a point-defence missile system, supported by a missile-armed helicopter. In addition, the ships were fitted for but not with a torpedo system, anti-ship missiles, and a close-in weapons system. The last ship of the class entered service in 2006; by this point, the RAN and RNZN had embarked on separate projects to improve the frigates' capabilities by fitting the additional weapons, along with updates to other systems and equipment.\n\nSince entering service, Anzac-class frigates have made multiple deployments outside local waters, including involvement in the INTERFET multi-national deployment to East Timor, and multiple operational periods in the Persian Gulf. As of 2014, all ten ships are in service. The RAN intends to start replacing theirs in 2024, while the RNZN ships will remain active until around 2030.\n\nThe Anzac design is derived from Blohm + Voss' MEKO 200 PN (or Vasco da Gama-class) frigate, and is identified by the company as the MEKO 200 ANZ.[43] In addition to capability modifications to meet RAN and RNZN requirements, the ships were redesigned during the development phase to maximize the involvement of Australian and New Zealand industries through the use of locally sourced components: 80% of the materials (by value) was locally sourced, and within this, 20% must come from New Zealand. The Anzacs were designed to German Navy standards, except where Australian or United States standards were specifically requested.\n\nEach frigate has a 3,600-tonne (3,500-long-ton; 4,000-short-ton) full load displacement. The ships are 109 meters (358 ft) long at the waterline, and 118 meters (387 ft) long overall, with a beam of 14.8 meters (49 ft), and a draught at full load of 4.35 meters (14.3 ft). The hull and superstructure are of all-steel construction, and the ships are fitted with fin stabilizers.\n\nThe frigates use a Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout, with a single, 30,172-horsepower (22,499 kW) General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two 8,840-horsepower (6,590 kW) MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship's two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is 27 knots (50 km/h; 31 mph), and maximum range is over 6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km; 6,900 mi) at 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph). The frigates' range is about 50% greater than other MEKO-type frigates, due to an enhanced fuel supply. Originally, two gas turbines were to be fitted; this layout would have provided a top speed of 31.75 knots (58.80 km/h; 36.54 mph). The starboard turbine was cancelled to save costs.\n\nThe standard ship's company of an Anzac consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors. Onboard electricity requirements are met by four MTU diesel generators. Each ship can carry up to 29 cubic meters (1,000 cu ft) of dry provisions, 29 cubic meters (1,000 cu ft) of refrigerated provisions, and 54 tons (53 long tons; 60 short tons) of fresh water.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1996, "countryOfOrigin": "Australia", "proliferation": "Australia", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Australia"], "dis": {"name": "FFH ANZAC CLASS", "string": "01.03.013.006.001.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "The Anzac class (also identified as the ANZAC class and the MEKO 200 ANZ type)."}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "10 Total Ships"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Frigate"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "AMECON"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "1996-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "163"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "118 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "14.8 m"}, {"name": "Draught", "value": "4.35 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Standard", "value": "3,000 tons"}, {"name": "Displacement, Full Load", "value": "3,600 tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Gas Turbine", "value": "1 \u00d7 General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine"}, {"name": "Gas Turbine Power", "value": "30,172 hp"}, {"name": "Diesel Engine", "value": "2 \u00d7 MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines"}, {"name": "Diesel Engine Power", "value": "8,840 hp each"}, {"name": "Propeller", "value": "2 \u00d7 controllable-pitch propellers"}, {"name": "Range", "value": "6,000 nautical miles (11,000 km;

This new class of small combatant augment the 60 HOUBEI-class wave-piercing catamaran missile patrol boats (PTG) (Type 022).\n\nThe frigate was deployed primarily for patrol and escort missions as well as anti-submarine operations and sea combat tasks, independent or in coordination with other forces. Its primary duty is to patrol sea areas. The South China Sea has relatively high requirements for single patrol boats because it is far from the coast and is often choppy.\n\nPatrolling is a daily labor-intensive task, and requires a large number of soldiers. Therefore, patrol boats should be deployed in a large scale and cost less than warships. Unlike fighting, patrolling does not need too many weapons. Overall, ships designed for patrolling should have good seakeeping ability and be relatively cheap.\n\nThe Type-056 frigate aimed at changing the situation of China's active-service base-defense system featuring aging military strength, single function and low combat power. The new-generation base-defense military strength commissioned in large quantities was another important platform for optimizing the equipment structure of the PLA Navy, improving the base-defense combat power as well as enhancing the PLA Navy's capability of safeguarding China's national security and territorial integrity, and defending China's maritime sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.\n\nThe construction of the 056 frigate has come to an end in late 2019 and the upgrading of the domestic offshore combat system has been completed. Type 056 frigate is a type 1 light frigate developed by the Chinese Navy in the new century. According to overseas sources, it has a length of 89 meters, a width of 12 meters, a full-load displacement of 1,300 tons, diesel power, dual-axis propulsion, a maximum speed of 28 knots, and a cruising range of 3,500 nautical miles. The type 056 frigate weapon and the onboard electronic system are relatively simple. The weapon includes two double-mounted YJ-83 anti-ship missile launchers, one 8-unit red flag 10 ship-to-air missile launcher, and the main gun is a 76 mm gun. , 2 30mm single-tube remote-control naval guns, and anti-submarine weapons are two 2-unit antisubmarine torpedo launchers. Shipborne electronic systems include air / sea search radars, optoelectronic fire control systems, electronic warfare systems, and shipborne combat systems. The bow has a helicopter take-off and landing deck, which can take off and land straight -9 anti-submarine helicopters, but there is no hangar, which limits its helicopter operation capabilities.\n\nThe Type 056 frigate weapon is relatively simple and mainly performs offshore patrol tasks. The PLA Navy had to build large warships if it is to go to the high sea, but large warship will be a waste of resources if it\u2019s only used for \u201cyard-protecing\u201d. The PLA Navy needed vessels that are suitable for carrying out fishing protection, patrol and guarding tasks at the \u201chouse gate\u201d, so that it can free the large combat ships from the trivial everyday maritime services and consequently ensure the combat capacity of main high-sea-going taskforces. With complete functions, the 056 guided missile frigate is capable of air defense, anti-submarine warfare, assault, and garrisoning. Such high cost effectiveness better caters to the rapidly increasing equipment manufacturing of the PLA Navy.\n\nThe PLA Navy\u2019s inshore combat tasks mainly consist of daily patrol, guarding, fishing protection, and other low-intensity and low-risk tasks. It provides the basic maritime force support for the civilian and law enforcement forces of oceanic administration and fishing affair bureau in coping with the provocations by military vessels of enemy states. Light surface vessels have to be used in the early stage of islands disputes. The flexible body and comprehensive combat capability of the 056 guided missile frigate decide that it is of best use on islands and the surrounding waters, where it can deal with all kinds of maritime crisis flexibly and make the mobilization and deployment of large vessels more effective.\n\nDesigned not solely for islands disputes but for more extensive purposes such as maritime target assaulting, air defense and anti-submarine, the 056 guide missile frigate is a light maritime striking weapon platform with the highest performance-price ratio and the widest applications. It can be manufactured by a number of coastal and inland shipyards on a large scale and in large quantities and supplied to the PLA Navy incessantly. Light guide missile frigate can serve as steady support for PLA Navy\u2019s high-sea-going maneuver combat and help free the inshore fast attack forces from everyday coast defense tasks, so as to establish a new-type inshore defensive combat system.\n\nChina has an 18,000km-long coastline to guard. The new-type frigate is able to engage in low-intensity conflicts and carry out patrol, escort and fishing protection tasks in key waters. It makes the military force structure more reasonable, shows greater flexibility in carrying out combat tasks, and will soon become the main combat equipment for base defense.\n\nMoreover, the large-scale commissioning of the new-type frigate was expected to exert considerable effects on the PLAN\u2019s combat thinking, methods of operation, training, management and application, talent cultivation and battlefield construction.\n\nThe long coastline needs to be patrolled, the disputes over several islands need to be solved, and the maritime transportation routes need to be protected. Guided missile frigate is the most economic choice if those issues need to be solved by force.\n\nAccording to a ranking by the British website Naval Technology, the Type-056 is one of the world's 10 best modern corvettes along with Sweden's Visby class and Germany's K130 Braunschweig class. Cao Weidong, a researcher at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, said despite the Type-056 class being smaller compared with frigates, it will be as powerful as frigates in battles in coastal waters thanks to its stealth design and strong firepower.\n\nBecause the ship's weapons and electronic systems are relatively simple, many international sources classify it as \"corvettes\" (light frigates) rather than \"frigates\". In fact, the Chinese Navy's original intention to develop the Type 056 frigate was also to replace the Type 037 hunting submarine, performing offshore patrol, escort, search and rescue tasks. For quite a long time, the Type 037 submarine hunting submarine has been the main battleship of the Chinese Navy's offshore defense, and has built more than 100 ships. However, the type 037 submarine hunting ship has a small tonnage and poor long-range combat capabilities, making it difficult to perform combat missions in far-off sea areas. After the 1990s, the Chinese Navy built several 053H frigates to perform such tasks, but the 053H frigate tactical and technical indicators had fallen behind. It is difficult to meet the needs of the battlefield in the new century. In this case, the 056 frigate appeared.\n\nThe first 056 frigate was started in 2011, launched in 2012, and delivered to the Navy in 2013. From a practical point of view, compared with the 037 frigate, the 056 frigate had a larger tonnage, more internal space, and can carry more supplies and materials, which is conducive to long-duty maritime operations. The crew's long-distance sea mission execution environment has been improved and efficiency has been improved. The ship was loved by the troops and became an ideal replacement for the 037 hunting submarine. Since then, the Type 056 frigate has entered a period of high-speed construction. It is reported that within about 9 years from 2011 to 2019, about 70 Type 056 frigates were built. On average, about 8 ships per year, and this speed can be said to be very amazing.\n\nAlong with rapid construction, the Type 056 frigate also developed a series of improved and modified ships. For example, in use, the army found that the 30mm single-barrel remote-control naval gun was not very useful and the price was relatively expensive. Large-caliber machine guns can be used for patrol tasks. Therefore, the latest batch of 14.5-mm naval machine guns was used instead. Considering that there are many advanced AIP submarines in the first island chain, the anti-submarine type was developed for this type 056. It is the first domestic surface ship equipped with active / passive towed line sonars, improving the ship's ability to resist modern quiet submarines. In order to cooperate with the advanced underwater acoustic system, the 056 anti-submarine type has been replaced with a new type of anti-submarine missile. The new missile uses a turbojet engine with a longer range and stronger attack capabilities. Sonar, better detection performance. The 056 anti-submarine service effectively improved the Chinese Navy's offshore anti-submarine combat capabilities.\n\nExports\nThe Type 056 1,440-ton class corvette is available for the export market with Bangladesh having ordered at least two ships and the Nigerian Navy ordering the P18N offshore patrol vessel with a full load displacement of 1,800 tons. In October 2012, the first ship P18N in Wuhan shipyard started. In 2013, Bangladesh and China signed a purchase for a group of vessels contract, believed to consist of two frigates, two patrol boats and six large patrol boats.\n\nType C13B [B for Bangladesh] is one of two light frigates ordered by the Bangladesh Navy in 2013. The ship was improved on the basis of Type 056. It replaced the weapon and radar system different from the domestic version and cancelled the anti-submarine capability. The most advanced frigate in the media, once known as China's export, its shape has been fully integrated with the overall trend of international light frigates. Although there is no such new trend as the chasing wind, the high cost performance has won the praise of the Bangladesh Navy. Two more ships have been added.\n\nThe Thai Navy's Pattani-class OPV bears a resemblance to the subsequent Chinese Type 056 corvette / light frigate, though the later is up-gunned relative to the the Thai OPV, with four YJ-3/C803 ASM and a FL-3000N RAM launcher aft, while the former has a much taller superstructure. Built for the Royal Thai Navy by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, each OPV cost about US$50 million. The vessels were commissioned in 2006-2007.\n\nIn November 2014 China completed sea trials of a offshore patrol ship on order for the Nigerian Navy that will assist in suppressing the growing threat of piracy off West African shores. The vessel was the first of two acquired by the Nigerian Navy to bolster its maritime surveillance, patrolling, search-and-rescue and to counter piracy. The patrol ship was launched by state-owned shipbuilder China Shipbuilding & Offshore International Co (CSOC) in January 2014, and was taken for sea trials by affiliated shipyard Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry.\n\nThe second patrol ship was built by CSOC in China but would be outfitted at the naval shipyard in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, in a technology transfer arrangement. According to specifications provided by CSOC, the ship has a full load displacement of 1,800 tonnes and can go 21 knots. The vessel can accommodate 75 crew, has 20 days endurance, and a standard range of 3,000 nautical miles.\n\nA computer-generated image issued by the Nigerian Navy suggested that the ship will have a helicopter hangar and landing deck. The weapons fit comprises a single 76mm NG-16-1 gun with a TR47 fire-control radar, as well as pairs of 30mm and 20mm guns. Nigerian Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Dele Ezeobam told reporters in January 2014 that the F 91 would be handed over mid-2014.\n\nThe Nigerian Navy is standing up to a host of challenges it faces in the Gulf of Guinea. Prior to 2009 before it commissioned the Sea Eagle-class patrol boats, the navy struggled to counter the often heavily armed pirates of West Africa.

In fact, the only commonality shared by both SAM system is the launcher design, and even the launchers differ in size due to the different diameters of the missiles used in the systems.\n\nInstead of using QW-1 Vanguard MANPADs, the FL-3000N system uses the HHQ-10 (Red Flag 10) naval surface to air missile developed from TY-90 missile. The diameter of the missile is enlarged by a third, but the most important design difference is its guidance system. The FL-3000N missile utilizes a combined guidance system that incorporates both passive radio frequency (RF) guidance and imaging infrared (ImIR) guidance. There are a pair of horn like protrusions mounted on the ImIR seeker at the tip of the missile, and these two protrusions are the passive RF seeker. An optional ImIR only guidance is also available and the missile is a fire and forget weapon.\n\nThe fire control system (FCS) of FL-3000N can simultaneously control two launchers, and can be integrated into other FCS on board ships. Alternatively, FL-3000N is also capable being directly controlled by other FCS on board ships. The system is usually fully automatic without human intervention, but manual operation can be inserted when needed.\n\nThe primary launching system of FL-3000N is a 24-cell launcher, developed from FLS-1. An optional extra magazine with automated loading system is available for larger warships when there is enough space provided. On smaller surface combatants where space is limited, the extra magazine with the automated loading system is eliminated and the reload is done manually. To further utilize confined space, an 8-cell launcher and a quadruple launcher are also available. Additionally, a single-cell launcher is available for mounting on existing naval gun mounts."}]}]}, {"name": "Gun Weapon Systems", "sections": [{"name": "Gun Weapon System #1", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "AK-176"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Naval Gun"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "76.2mm"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "1 \u00d7 AK-176 76mm. gun stations"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "4484 mm"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "16,800 kg"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "2 (4 in manual control mode)"}, {"name": "Barrels", "value": "1"}, {"name": "Elevation", "value": "-15\u00b0 to +85\u00b0"}, {"name": "Traverse", "value": "\u00b1175\u00b0"}, {"name": "Rate of Fire", "value": "120 rds/min"}, {"name": "Muzzle Velocity", "value": "980 m/s"}, {"name": "Maximum Firing Range", "value": "15 km"}, {"name": "Effective Firing Range", "value": "10 km"}, {"name": "Feed System", "value": "152 ready to fire rounds"}]}, {"name": "Ammunition Gun Weapon System #1", "properties": [{"name": "Type", "value": "Rifle"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "76.2", "units": "mm"}, {"name": "Shell", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Shell Weight", "value": "12.4 kg"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "INA"}]}, {"name": "Gun Weapon System #2", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "Type 730"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Close-In Weapon System (CIWS)"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "30mm"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "2 x Type 730 CIWS"}, {"name": "Main Armament", "value": "1\u00d730 mm H/PJ-12 or H/PJ-11 Gatling gun"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Barrels", "value": "7-barrel"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "Automated, with human oversight"}, {"name": "Rate of Fire", "value": "1,200-4,200 rounds/minute"}, {"name": "Maximum Firing Range", "value": "3 km"}, {"name": "Effective Firing Range", "value": "1\u20131.5 km"}, {"name": "Feed System", "value": "Type 730: One ammunition boxes, holding 640 rounds"}, {"name": "Guidance System", "value": "TR47C J-band radar\nOFC-3 electro-optical fire control system"}]}, {"name": "Ammunition Gun Weapon System #2", "properties": [{"name": "Type", "value": "Rifle"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "30mm"}, {"name": "Shell", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Shell Weight", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Basic Load", "value": "INA"}]}]}, {"name": "Torpedo Weapon System", "properties": [{"name": "Torpedo Tubes", "value": "2 \u00d7 triple 324mm. torpedo tubes"}, {"name": "Torpedo Name", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Torpedo Basic Load", "value": "INA"}]}, {"name": "Onboard Aviation Facilities", "properties": [{"name": "Facilities", "value": "Helipad for 1 medium-lift helicopter"}, {"name": "Helicopters", "value": "1 x Z-9C Helicopter"}]}, {"name": "Fire Control", "properties": [{"name": "FCS Name", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Computerized FCS", "value": "INA"}]}, {"name": "Radar Systems", "sections": [{"name": "Radar: Type 347G Naval Gun Fire Control and Tracking Radar System (NGFS)", "properties": [{"name": "Name:", "value": "Type 347G Radar"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Monopulse Naval Gun Fire Control and Tracking Radar System (NGFS)"}, {"name": "Alternate Designation", "value": "TR47C"}, {"name": "Proliferation", "value": "Chinese"}, {"name": "Frequency", "value": "X Band"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Pulse Width", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Polarization", "value": "Vertical"}, {"name": "Beam Width", "value": "1.8\u00b0\u00b10.2\u00b0"}, {"name": "PRF", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Scan Rate", "value": "360\u00b0 (Az); -25\u00b0~85\u00b0 (El)"}, {"name": "Resolution", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Range", "value": "30 km against RCS aircraft ; 15 km against: ASM"}, {"name": "Antenna", "value": "Circular parabolic antenna, Temp Range: -25C-+70C"}, {"name": "Notes", "value": "Radar uses a coherent pulse doppler design.

The contract was awarded to GEC-Marconi in 1995 and the ships, a variant of the F2000 design, were launched in January 2001, June 2001 and June 2002 at the then BAE Systems Marine yard at Scotstoun, Glasgow. The customer refused to accept the vessels and the contract dispute became the subject of arbitration. When the dispute was settled in favour of BAE Systems, the vessels were handed over to Royal Brunei Technical Services in June 2007.\n\nIn 2007, Brunei contracted the German L\u00fcrssen shipyard to find a new customer for the three ships; in November 2012, it was announced that Indonesia had signed a memorandum of understanding with Britain to acquire the vessels for one-fifth of the original unit cost. The ships are now in service with the Indonesian Navy.\n\nThe ships were originally armed with MBDA Exocet Block II anti-ship missiles and MBDA Seawolf air defence missiles.

Fuxianhu (888) is a fixed-point [ie, island] supply ship built by the Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) for the PLA Navy. The ship was launched on 25 December 2006 and commissioned by the South Sea Fleet in 2007. Fuxianhu was based on the hull design and propulsion system of the Qiandaohu (Fuchi) class fleet replenishment ship, but with a smaller displacement (~15,000 tonnes). The ship was designed to transport personnel and supplies from mainland to the remote islands in the South China Sea.\n\nUnlike the normal replenishment ship, Fuxianhu does not have the fuel and stores rigs for underway replenishment. Instead, the ship carries six four landing craft (LCVP) at amidships and two small utility boats at stern to ferry personnel and supplies between the mother ship and shore. The ship replaced the older Dayuan class supply ships built in the 1980s for the similar role. Fuxianhu has a large single-spot flight deck to support one medium-size helicopter such as Z-8 and Ka-28, but has no hanger. Its armament includes a Type 76F twin-37mm AAA gun, with a range of 8.5km for airborne targets.\n\nNATO codename is DANYAO class [Danyao = ammunition]. Support ship built at Guangzhou, and launched on 28 December 2006. The ship is equipped with two pairs of davits, capable of handling small landing craft, and a flight deck for medium helicopters. Potential roles for the ship include resupply of the Spratly and Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. Following sea trials in 2007, the ship is reported to have been commissioned in late 2007 and to be based in the South Sea Fleet.\n\nRather than fleet replenishment missions, this type combined with comprehensive supply ship in the Chinese Navy as an island replenishment ship, the same as a supply ship, but the primary duty is to transport goods to islands. Because this ship is built like a replenishment ship, the hull and superstructure arrangement is similar to the underway replenishment type. However, the center of the ship has boat davits, fro a total of four units are equipped with a transport craft to land supplies. As large ships cannot approach an atoll, transport craft are used for replenishment of the port facility.\n\nThe ship had 76 F type 37 mm twin mount guns, and 14.5 mm twin machine guns mounted on the rear structure. Hangar with a Z-8A transport helicopter was set up, but the Fushun Lake is replaced the hangar with a helicopter flight deck. Fushun Lake is designed with emphasis on military capacities and goods transport capacity to advance base ( Spratly Islands, such as personnel and supplies).\n\nType 904B fixed-point supply ship\nOn September 26, 2014, the Guangzhou Shipyard International Shipyard launched the first modified 904B fixed-point supply ship, its basic design and Fuxian Lake similar, but back to the helicopter hangar, to further strengthen the helicopter operating capacity; 904B in July 10, 2015 enlisted, named the mountain Hill (961). In January 2015, internet photos showed the Guangzhou Shipyard International plant there were more 904-type fixed-point supply ship in the construction. As the sovereignty issue intensified between China and Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries in the South China Sea, China also expanded the island of reefs, the island reef fixed supply demand increased, so 904B fixed-point supply ship will continue work.\n\nThe biggest differences between the Type 904B supply ship Luguhu (Hull No. 962) and its predecessor Type 904A supply ship Fuxianhu are that, instead of the portal frame type platform, which is specific to the comprehensive supply ship, on the supply ship Luguhu, there are two davits mounted on each side in the middle section of the ship and a hangar which enhances the vertical replenishment capacity. The ship is designed to provide material supply for the troops stationed in the Nansha islands, and undertake such tasks as providing supply for a ship formation and maritime medical aid at a certain degree.\n\nThe hull and bridge fuller, the chimney also changed from the previous two, the rear mast is between the two chimney. The installation of the helicopter hangar, apparently in order to stay away from the mainland where the vertical supply is needed. The power system may also be improved.\n\nThe 904B-type transport supply ship relative to the A-type has improved performance. Sea supplies are mainly to supplement the warships in combat or sailing in the consumption of oil supplies and so on. Supply the main sub-cargo and dry goods two categories. Liquid cargo is mainly warships of diesel, aviation fuel, machine lubricants, fresh water and so on. Dry goods are mainly a variety of models of ammunition, food, machinery spare parts, spare weapons, additional soldiers, etc. Its displacement is still 15,000 tons, storage of fuel and fresh water more than 10,000 tons, food, ammunition and other materials more than 1,000 tons.\n\nThe 904 B-type self-defense firepower has significantly enhanced. The ship and the ship's two 37-mm machine guns, facelift into 2011 just developed H / PJ15 single tube 30 mm hand-mounted naval gun. The gun uses the LLP12A new fire control system developed by Northern Industries 206, with radar and optoelectronic channels, equipped with automatic photoelectric guidance station, all aspects of performance are far above the 37 mm machine gun. The supply ship is also equipped with a number of 14.5 mm machine guns, used to deal with the threat of close range.\n\nThe internal facilities are more complete. 904B-type superstructure is much larger, the internal space is also larger, staff living area and equipment are stronger than the older generation. It can not have a complete processing workshop, repair shop, and even a female dedicated cabin.\n\nThe ship's self-defense capability is relatively weak, in fact, from the use of 904A point of view, 904B no need to focus on independent combat capability. These supply ships are basically in the first island chain within the supply activities, and these waters is basically the Chinese Air Force's combat power is easy to cover, as the comprehensive supply ship do their own work.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1992, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "AF DAYUN TYPE 904 CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.016.030.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 904 Class; Type 904A Class; Type 904B Class; Dayun Class"}, {"name": "Total Built", "value": "Type 904: 2 Built; Type 904A: 1 Built; Type 904B: 2 Built, 1 under construction"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "General Stores Issue Ship"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "Jiangnan Shipyard"}, {"name": "In Service", "value": "1992-Present"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "240"}, {"name": "Type 904", "value": "Built by Qiuxin (\u6c42\u65b0) Shipyard of Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, Type 904 (and its successor Type 904A) are frequently but erroneously referred by many as underway replenishment ships.

The Type 022 was 43 meters (140 feet) long and displaces 225 tons. It was equipped with two missile launchers and has a top speed of 38 knots. The Type 022 was the PLA Navy's new-generation stealth missile fast attack craft (FAC). The boat features a unique high-speed, wave-piercing catamaran hull design with evident radar cross-section reduction design features. A number of Chinese shipyards across the country were involved in the construction of the boat.\n\nThe Salvo equations are the successors to Lanchester Equations whose square law was applied to the formation of battleships. Specifically, the salvo equations apply when missiles or torpedoes are fired in batches instead of \u201ccontinuously.\u201d The salvo-like phenomenon was also seen in the five big Pacific carrier battles in World War II in which each side endeavored to detect and attack first with all its air wings simultaneously in a single pulse, or \u201csalvo,\u201d of aircraft attacking as a coordinated unit. The salvo equations show that if a fleet has three times as many combatants, then for parity in loss ratios (in other words, which side will have ships remaining when all of the opponents are out of action), to overcome a numerical advantage each of my ships must have thrice the offensive power, thrice the defensive power, and thrice the survivability (the \u201cstaying power\u201d). The weight of ordnance to put a warship out of action increases only as of the one-third power of its displacement, making smaller missile ships a cost-effective offensive capability.\n\nAnother general property of missile warfare shown by the equations is that if ship numbers and staying power are both small, then an unstable combat situation arises, in which the shift in results of exchange moves from total victory to total loss within a small change in the number of ships on either side. This is to an extent an artifact of the equation structure, but it is a warning that a fleet of big surface warships can be put out of action with a small number of missile hits in 21st Century combat.\n\nThis first ship appears to be focused on the FAC mission and appears to be designed for the installation of anti-ship missile launchers amidship (in the middle of the ship). But some speculated that the Chinese will soon design and build larger models that can carry UAVs and small boats for landing commandoes, as the U.S. may soon be doing. The Chinese probably already has its version of the digital connectivity which lies at the heart of the LCS program. So here is an area of military-technical competition in which the Chinese are demonstrating creativity and potential ability to match the U.S. just as it was embarking on a new direction in naval warship and combat tactics modernization.\n\nThe new Chinese FAC design also demonstrates that the real naval threat from China was not aircraft carriers and large destroyers bought from Russia. The real threat was quiet diesel submarines and small ships like this new FAC. The real potential of this new design would be its use in coordination with their diesel subs and, possibly, theater ballistic missiles with precision guidance. A combination like that could enable the Chinese to deny the U.S. Navy the ability to safely move in some vital areas, such as the waters surrounding Taiwan\n\nFirst spotted under construction at Qiuxin Shipyard in Summer 2004, the vessel completed sea trials in late 2004 and was possibly commissioned in 2005. It was followed by three additional boats (2209, 2210, and 2211) in or around the 2005-06 time period. More hulls were subsequently spotted under construction at other locations starting in early 2006. The Type 022 appeared to be replacing the aging Type 021 (Huangfeng class) missile FAC in the PLA Navy service.\n\nAfter several years of extensive prototype testing, Quixin then produced hulls 2209, 2210, and 2211. Many observers thought this could be only a four-ship design, such as the People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN's) previous five new guided-missile destroyers (DDG) designs of only one or two hulls since 1991. The startup of production for additional Type 022 hulls in Dalian, Quixin, and Jiangnan shipyards in Shanghai, as well as in the Huangpu shipyard in Guangzhou, changed this precept. A large number of wave-piercing catamaran Type 022 hulls being launched several at a time at five different shipyards was a major event in PLAN shipbuilding. By early 2008 China was believed to have built as many as 40 Type 022 missile boats to replace the aging Huangfeng class missile boats.\n\nThe Type 022 Houbei PCFG appeared to be building at a rate of about 10 units per year. The August 2009 US Office of Naval Intelligence report \"The People's Liberation Army Navy: A Modern Navy With Chinese Characteristics\" stated \" ... the PLA(N) has built up its long-range capability, it has also reinforced its coastal defense and near-littoral strengths with the introduction of the highly-capable Houbei class guided-missile patrol craft (PTG) in 2004. The Houbei utilizes a wave-piercing catamaran hull form, probably based on a commercial fast ferry design, and water jet propulsion to attain considerably better seakeeping, speed, and mission flexibility than the older Gsa and Houku missile boats that they replaced. The relatively low construction, operating, and crew costs of the Houbeis have allowed China to build well over 50 by 2007, with more under construction.\"\n\nAbout the new stealth boat, the U.S. Congress submitted to Congress Armed Services Committee report entitled \"China's impact on the U.S. Navy's modernization,\" the report said, \"2004 China launched anti-ship cruise missile-equipped attack boats, the boat prominent stealth performance, can quickly walk through the waves, and has a double hull shape of the double hull is a more advanced hull shape design, the world's navies are trying this design approach in this area was currently a leading Australian company. \"\n\nIn recent years, China and Australia have engaged in the production of different types of wave-piercing vessels. So far, China produced a total of several models of civilian-type Rogue boats. The general law of development of the shipbuilding industry, the continuous improvement of 022 boats will refer to civilian-type catamaran trends. China's missile boats have used French diesel engines, and with high-power engines, the type 022 may reach 40 or more full speed. The most noteworthy was that all 022 missile boats are equipped with one-way hn900 tactical data links, which can work together to achieve the intent. It can collaborate with other frigates, missile destroyers, shore-based reconnaissance, early warning aircraft, boats, and even between the implementation of the \"proper reach,\" the distant sea offensive operations.\n\nAs a result of jet propulsion, with no propeller, the 022 more than anyone Chinese navy missile boats to was quiet, especially when at high speed. Chinese military's \"Liberation Army Daily\" reported that \"China Water National Key Laboratory of acoustic vibration casing vibration and noise reduction technology research made fruitful achievements in scientific research.\" Military experts believe that this technology was important for high-speed vessels. Type 022 stealth missile boats with double hull shape, highlighting the invisibility.\n\nThe Chinese trimaran fast attack craft (FAC) design may grow into a larger more versatile platform, similar to the U.S. Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program. China Shipbuilding Trading Corporation (CSSC) revealed a concept for a 700 tonne derivative of the PLAN's Type 022 catamaran fast attack craft (FAC). The design was modeled in February 2017 at Abu Dhabi\u2019s IDEX expedition and showcased many possible features for the vessel. It was armed with a 76 mm gun and four anti-ship missile launchers. CSSC officials said the PLAN has so far shown no interest in this version and there are no plans to build it. The CSSC consortium, comprised of over a dozen Chinese industry shipbuilders, showcased designs for export vessels, mostly based on existing designs from the Chinese Coast Guard or the Navy.\n\nThere was no indication that China was building an additional level of conventional missile boats, showing the 022-boat, and on the basis of improvement, improved missile boats could become China's future development direction.\n\nA workshop sponsored by the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Office of Net Assessment on retaining American influence in East Asia led to a report published in October 2011. The workshop participants advocated four force elements to reduce the chance of Chinese aggression and a shooting war. One component is a flotilla of small, highly lethal combatants that can be sent on the surface into the China Seas. Analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School and wargaming at the Naval War College independently saw the potential of such low-cost missile combatants and the need for a more detailed examination, since no such capability exists in the U.S.Navy.", "dateOfIntroduction": 2004, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "China", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["China"], "dis": {"name": "PG HOUBEI TYPE 022 CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.007.015.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 22 Class;

In 1960, a hybrid of all the prototypes, Type 0111 was laid down at Dalian shipyard, Luda. Full production variants became known as the Type 062-class.\n\nA total of 30 were built, initial boats being known as the Shanghai I class and later slightly improved boats being known as the Shanghai II class. Some boats even remained in active service well into the early 1990s. The Shanghai I class was slightly smaller than its successor, the Shanghai II class, displacing 125 tons instead of 135 tons, and had a twin Chinese Type 66 57 mm gun mount forward. All other specifications are identical to the Shanghai II class, which replaced the 57 mm with twin 37 mm gun mounts.\n\nThe L-12V-180 diesel engines used on the Type 062 were prone to overheat, thirsty for fuel and had a poor working life. So the smaller L-12D-6 diesel engine was introduced. The new engine was more fuel efficient and had longer life, but rated only 910 horsepower (680 kW), resulting in a maximum speed of only 28.5 knots (52.8 km/h; 32.8 mph). The low speed disappointed PLAN and thus one of the reason construction ended at 30 boats.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1958, "countryOfOrigin": "China, People's Republic of", "proliferation": "Albania, Bangladesh, China, Congo, East Timor (Timor-Leste), Egypt, North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tunisia", "selectedregions": [], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Albania", "Bangladesh", "China", "Congo", "East Timor (Timor-Leste)", "Egypt", "North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)", "Pakistan", "Sri Lanka", "Tunisia"], "dis": {"name": "PC SHANGHAI II TYPE 062 CLASS", "string": "01.03.045.007.007.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Type 062 Class; NATO: Shanghai II Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Gunboat"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "China; Shipyard: INA"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "36"}]}, {"name": "Dimensions", "properties": [{"name": "Length", "value": "41 m"}, {"name": "Beam", "value": "5.3 m"}, {"name": "Draft", "value": "1.8 m"}, {"name": "Displacement, Full Load", "value": "170 long tons"}]}, {"name": "Propulsion System", "properties": [{"name": "Engine Name", "value": "2 \u00d7 Chinese L-12V-180A"}, {"name": "Engine Type", "value": "Diesel"}, {"name": "Engine Power", "value": "4,400 hp"}, {"name": "Maximum Range", "value": "1,210 km at 17 knots"}, {"name": "Maximum Speed", "value": "31", "units": "km/h"}]}, {"name": "Gun Weapon Systems", "sections": [{"name": "Gun Weapon System #1", "properties": [{"name": "Name", "value": "Type 76A"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Close-In Weapon System (CIWS)"}, {"name": "Caliber", "value": "37mm"}, {"name": "Quantity", "value": "4 x Type 76A Close-In Weapon System (CIWS)"}, {"name": "Length", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Weight", "value": "INA"}, {"name": "Rate of Fire", "value": "400 rd/min"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "The Type 76A is a fully enclosed and fully automatic model in the Type 76 series.

Unlike western navies, the People's Liberation Army Navy does not have dedicated patrol boats in its inventory. Instead, a large variety of corvette type classes, in the form of missile boats and submarine chasers fulfill the tasks of patrolling China's territorial waters. The Egyptian Navy operates eight vessels.\n\nThe Type 037 submarine chaser (NATO reporting name: Hainan class), is a class of submarine chaser of the People's Liberation Army Navy. It was designed by China to replace the Soviet S.O.-1 class submarine chaser.\n\nIn addition to anti-submarine warfare missions, these simple yet effective units are also capable of a wide variety of missions such as mine laying and patrol. These boats were first equipped with Soviet Tamir-11 (MG-11, NATO reporting name: Stag Hoof) hull-mounted sonars which had a typical range of 3 km (1.9 mi), but in the 1970s, they were superseded by domestic Chinese SJD-3 sonar, which is modification of original MG-11: instead of being fixed to the hull, SJD-3 has a telescoping arm, so when not in use, the sonar is stored in the hull, and when deployed, the sonar is lowered into water several meter below the hull, thus increased detection range by avoiding baffles generated by the hull.\n\nDuring the Sino-South Vietnamese naval clashes on 19 January 1974, two boats of this class, # 281 & # 282 (two out of the eight total in Chinese inventory) participated in the latter half of the battle, the fastest Chinese units in the conflict. Originally the units were waiting at Yongxing Island, but due to the problem of communications, they were not notified until the battle was already in progress.\n\nOver 100 were built, but as newer submarine chasers enter service, this class is steadily being decommissioned. A number of these ships have subsequently been exported to Bangladesh, Egypt, North Korea, Pakistan and Myanmar. On October 13, 2013, A North Korean Type 037 was lost off Wonsan with the loss of at least nineteen of her crew.

The Chinese variant is known as the Type 033 Romeo. A total of 84 Type 033 submarines were built in China from 1962 to 1984, plus several exported to other countries.\n\nThe Chinese Type 033 incorporated some improvements over the original Romeo, including noise reduction of 20 dB. Sonar onboard was also continuously upgraded: the original Soviet sonar was first replaced by domestic Chinese Type 105 sonar, which consequently was replaced by H/SQ2-262A sonar built by No. 613 Factory. Today most of the Type 033 subs have been retired or preserved, with a few remaining in service for training purposes. A total of six Chinese Romeo class submarine variants were developed:\n\nType 6633: Original Chinese-built Romeo, China was to have assembled these Romeos from knock-down kits provided by the Soviet Union, 6 were planned, but only 2 were completed. The construction program came to a complete stop when the USSR stopped the delivery of parts following the Sino-Soviet split. Construction of the 3rd unit at Wuhan was stopped, and available parts were diverted to complete the first pair, but many parts had to be developed indigenously. The primary improvement of Type 6633 over the original Soviet boats is the use of domestic Chinese batteries, which had slightly superior performance to that of the original Soviet batteries.\n\nType 033: Complete domestic production in China was achieved in 1967, and subsequently the project has renamed the Type 033. However, experience from deployment of completed boats in warmer climates proved that the original Soviet refrigeration and air conditioning system designed for the subarctic and arctic area was woefully inadequate for subtropical and tropical regions, so redesigns were needed to improve refrigeration and air conditioning systems, and all boats to be stationed in tropical and subtropical regions went through such a refit. In September 1969 construction of new Type 033s, with improved air conditioning and refrigeration capability, began at Huangpu Shipyard in Guangzhou, eventually, 13 units were completed.\n\nES5A: Upgraded Type 033, with improvements mainly involving the replacement of equipment of Soviet origin with domestic Chinese systems, which includes: QZHA\u201510 (Type 779) attack periscope and QDYA\u201510 (Type 778) general-purpose periscope. Addition of H/SQG-2 ranging sonar, Type 063 communication systems, and countermeasure systems. Domestic Chinese Type 801 sonar replaced the original Soviet MARS-24 sonar. The only difference between the Type 801 sonar and the MARS-24 sonar is that there are 24 transducer elements for the Type 801 as opposed to 12 in the original MARS 24, so the Chinese sonar had better accuracy. Domestic Chinese H/SQZ-D reconnaissance sonar (with Type 105 transducers) replaced the original Soviet system, the performance of the SQZ-D is almost identical to the original Soviet sonar it was developed from, except for the sector of the scan, which is increased by 15 degrees. Additional noise reduction measures were also adopted. This is the type China originally sold to Egypt in the 1980s.\n\nType 033G: Development of the ES5A, with the incorporation of the capability to launch acoustic homing torpedoes; analog computers installed to achieve automation of, and speeding up of, torpedo fire control calculations that were previously manually calculated. All Chinese Romeos were converted to this standard. The NATO reporting name for this type is rumored to be the Wuhan class.\nType 033G1: A single Type 033G was modified to carry 6 YJ-1 (CSS-N-4) anti-ship missiles, this variant is called Type 033G1, with the rumored NATO reporting name of Wuhan A. The missile had to be fired while the boat was surfaced, with a total exposure time on the surface of fewer than 7 minutes. The most significant improvement, however, is the reduction of the noise level by 12 dB.\nES5B: Development of the Type 033G, primarily intended for export. This is an upgrade package for Romeo submarine users. The primary improvement of this class is the ability to launch wire-guided torpedoes and anti-ship missiles (AShM) while submerged. The program began in the mid-1980s, and Egypt is reported to be the only customer when China won a contract to upgrade its Romeo-class submarine fleet, including both Soviet-built and Chinese-built units. This is the last type of Chinese Romeo class submarine; with a noise reduction of 20 dB to 140 dB in comparison to the 160 dB of the original Soviet Project 633 submarines acquired by China."}], "type": "WEG", "version": 1}, "images": [{"name": "Romeo_Class_(CC).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/d/d2/Romeo_Class_%28CC%29.jpg"}, {"name": "Romeo_clsss_submarine(A).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/9/9b/Romeo_clsss_submarine%28A%29.jpg"}, {"name": "Romeo_clsss_submarine(B).jpg", "url": "/mediawiki/images/6/62/Romeo_clsss_submarine%28B%29.jpg"}], "categories": ["WEG", "Naval Watercraft", "Submarines", "Diesel-Electric Patrol and Attack Submarines", "Russia (RUS)", "PRO_Egypt", "PRO_North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea)", "Sea", "Tier4"]}, {"title": "Type 054 Class (Jiangkai I Class) Chinese Frigate", "id": 11349, "json": {"tiers": [false, true, false, false], "notes": "The Type 054 (NATO Codename Jiangkai I) frigate is a Chinese multi-role warship that were commissioned in the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force in 2005.

The ships were designed for coastal anti-submarine warfare. In case of an all-out NATO-Warsaw Pact war in Europe their prime targets would have been the small U-206 coastal submarines of the West German navy. The first ship, Wismar (now the Indonesian KRI Sutanto), was launched on 9 April 1981 in Rostock, and subsequently another 15 ships were built until 1986. To make production more economical, the Soviet Union agreed to purchase another 12 ships from Wolgaster Peenewerft built between 1986 and 1990, thereby effectively subsidising the East German shipbuilding industry.\n\nThe ships of the Soviet Navy were named Parchim II by NATO. Though useful as a coastal ASW platform, the Soviet production of the similar but far more powerful Grisha class made this purchase even more illogical for the Soviet Navy. After German re-unification the former East German ships were sold to the TNI-AL (Indonesian Navy) in 1993. The Indonesian Navy extensively refurbished their Parchims, to the point where the refurbishing exceeded the cost of purchase. They are still in service, both in the Indonesian Navy and in the Russian Baltic Fleet.\n\nFor air defence, the ships were equipped with one double-barrel AK-230 30 mm gun and one double-barrel AK-725 57 mm gun. The Ak-725 double 57 mm AA gun, designed in 1959, was directed by the ESP-72 fire control system, which received ranging and target bearing information from an MR 103 (NATO codename 'MUFF COB') radar. The MR 103 had a 1.30 m (4.3 ft) parabolic radar dish, with an optical camera system slaved to it, as a backup system in case of failure or heavy EW environment. The barrels of the gun were water-cooled and belt-fed, with each belt containing 550 rounds, but the first round had to be manually chambered. In an emergency, the turret could be manually operated with an optical fire control system. The MR 103 radar system, already outdated when the Parchims were developed, used 1950s-style electromechanical systems, built around vacuum tubes. As a result, it wasn't considered to be an effective anti-missile system, or CIWS (Close-in weapon system), as was evidenced by a Soviet training accident in 1987 when a test missile drone accidentally locked in on a small Soviet Navy training vessel. Although the ship's AK-725 system kept firing until the moment of impact, no hits were scored and the ship was destroyed by the resulting fire, allegedly killing 39 crew members.\n\nThe AK-230 gun was a fully automatic, stabilized, NN-30 double-barrel, water-cooled, four-chamber revolver cannon. The guns had a 1,000 round per minute (rpm) rate of fire and were fed by independent 500 round ammunition belts. The regular associated radar system was the (NATO codename) DRUM TILT radar, which was not used in the Parchim class. According to some sources the AK-230 could not only be linked with the DRUM TILT but also with the MUFF COB radar system, but this is disputed by old East German naval sources. According to these East German sources, the AK-230 gun on the Parchim-class corvette was optically guided, thereby leaving the Parchim class without an effective CIWS, and therefore unable to counter anti-shipping missiles.\n\nThere were also two SA-N-5 (Naval SA-7 or Strela II) MANPAD positions aboard the Parchims. But without an effective, radar guided SAM missile system, the Parchims were left completely vulnerable to enemy precision guided anti-shipping weapons. This was a major restriction and confined the Parchims to brown water coastal operations, close to the protective air force and air defence umbrella.\n\nThe air search radar was the ubiquitous (NATO codename) STRUT CURVE radar. This radar had a 4 m (13 ft) parabolic radar dish, worked in the F-band frequency, and had a respectable 60 nautical miles (110 km) radar range against aircraft flying at 5,000 m (16,000 ft) height, and a less respectable 20 nautical miles (40 km) radar range against surface shipping or low flying aircraft. The electronic defense suite was very basic, and consisted of an IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) receiver and transmitter, and an 'ELOKA' multiband passive RWR antenna slaved to a double 16-cell chaff dispenser. All in all, air defence - or the lack of one - was a very restrictive factor in the tactical usefulness of the Parchim design.", "dateOfIntroduction": 1981, "countryOfOrigin": "Indonesia", "proliferation": "Indonesia, Russian Federation", "selectedregions": ["All Regions"], "checkedregions": [], "checkedcountries": ["Indonesia", "Russian Federation"], "dis": {"name": "FS KAPITAN PATIMURA CLASS", "string": "01.03.100.050.004.000.000"}, "sections": [{"name": "System", "properties": [{"name": "Alternative Designation", "value": "Kapitan Patimura Class"}, {"name": "Type", "value": "Corvette"}, {"name": "Builder", "value": "VEB Peenewerft, Wolgast, Germany"}, {"name": "Crew", "value": "61 (6 off. + 55 enl.)"}, {"name": "Note", "value": "The PARCHIM-I class corvettes were the largest domestic-built combatants in the East German navy before Germany was reunified in October 1990.

In 1960, two other versions of the mounting appeared; a single gun ZIF-71 for the modernised Skoryy class destroyers and the quad ZIF-75 for the Krupny/Kanin class destroyers. The ZIF designation is an industrial one and it is possible that the naval designations were AK-157 (ZIF-71), AK-257 (ZIF-31) and AK-457 (ZIF-75). In smaller warships these mountings were sometimes associated with MR-103 and in larger ones with the Yakhond (Hawk Screech) radar. The ZIF-31/71/75 mountings may not have been very successful and an improved twin mounting appeared shortly afterwards as the AK-725.

The ships had a standard displacement of 571 tonnes (562 long tons) and 605 t (595 long tons) at full load. This later increased to 625 t (615 long tons) at full load. A 5.1 tonnes (5 long tons) container can be stored aboard the ships for additional supply room. The minehunters had an initial complement of 55, this was later reduced to 49.\n\nThe \u00c9ridan-class minehunters have two independent propulsion systems. In normal operations the minehunters are powered by a 1,400-kilowatt (1,900 bhp) Brons-Werkspoor (later W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4) A-RUB 215V-12 diesel engine turning one shaft with a LIPS controllable pitch propeller. Using the conventional system, the minehunters have a maximum speed of 15 knots (28 km/h; 17 mph) and a range of 3,000 nautical miles (5,600 km; 3,500 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph). For use when minehunting the vessels have two 180 kW (240 hp) ACEC active rudders and a bow thruster. These are energised by three Astazou IVB gas turbine alternators rated at 150 kW. A fourth diesel-driven alternator rated at 160 kW supplies power during normal operations. Both systems can be operated from the bridge or from a soundproof control centre above the main deck. The maximum speed using the minehunting propulsion system that can be achieved is 7 knots (13 km/h; 8.1 mph).\n\nThe minehunters were equipped with DUBM 21B sonar that could detect and classify ground and moored mines to a range of 80 metres (260 ft). The sonar was retracted during normal operations. The vessel was also equipped with Racal Decca 1229 radar. The vessels carried two ECA PAP 104 remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs). In 2001, the minesweepers underwent modernisation and the sonar was replaced with the TUS 2022 Mk III type, the radar with the Bridgemaster E250 type and a TSM 2061 combat data system and a Bofors Double Eagle Mk2 ROV were fitted.\n\nThe \u00c9ridan class is armed with one 20 mm mod\u00e8le F2 gun capable of firing 720 rounds per minute to a range of 2 kilometres (1.2 mi). The minehunters also mount one 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine gun and two 7.62 mm (0.30 in) machine guns. The French vessels have limited minesweeping ability and were initially only fitted with mechanical sweep gear.

Originally, a total of four ships were planned, but eventually, only one was completed due to the availability of newer designs.\n\nPLAN originally issued a requirement of four spy ships to meet its urgent need, after the failure of the earlier cancelled Type 812. To speed up the program, PLAN suggested adopting the hull of Type 635C hydrographic survey ship. The 1st Directorate of the 708th Institute of China State Shipbuilding Corporation, which is also more commonly known as China Shipbuilding and Oceanic Engineering Design Academy nowadays, was assigned to design the ship. However, after the design was completed, it was revealed that the design could not meet requirements issued by PLAN during design review. On March 25, 1980, PLAN issued an order to revise the design to 1500 tons, designated as Type 814. On June 30, 1980, the 708th Institute completed the revision. However, due to drastic changes made by PLAN, it was once again revealed during design review that the revised design could not efficiently meet the new requirements issued by PLAN. The designer recommended enlarging the ship by increasing the displacement by twenty percent from 1500 tons to 1800 tons. The recommendation was accepted and in February 1982 the revision was completed, and in August 1982, design was completed. The finalized design is designated as Type 814A. In August 1983, design work for construction was completed and construction began on December 22, 1983. During sea trials, various aircraft and naval warships were deployed in support of trials, including Type 033 submarines, Harbin SH-5, Harbin H-5, submarine chasers, Type 051 destroyers and Type 403 shore based radars. On-board systems such as acoustic, radar, communication, and optical systems proved satisfactory and the ship was accepted into service in the North Sea Fleet. Because the previous design was experienced excessive vibration, particular attention in design was given to reduce vibration. Type 814A is designed to withstand wind scale of 12.

It is a multi-role class that was designed for secondary roles of surface warfare and anti-aircraft warfare and originally designed with a primary role of naval gunfire support. It was intended to take the place of battleships in meeting a congressional mandate for naval fire support. The ship is designed around its two Advanced Gun Systems, their turrets and magazines, and unique Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) ammunition. LRLAP procurement was cancelled, rendering the guns unusable, so the Navy re-purposed the ships for surface warfare. Procurement was halted after the first three Zumwalts, and the Navy reverted to building more Arleigh Burke destroyers. A National Review article by Mike Fredenburg calls the Zumwalts \"an unmitigated disaster\". The class design emerged from the DD-21 \"land attack destroyer\" program as \"DD(X)\".\n \nThese ships are classed as destroyers, but they are much larger than any other active destroyer or cruiser. The vessels' distinctive appearance results from the design requirement for a low radar cross-section (RCS). The Zumwalt-class has a wave-piercing tumblehome hull form whose sides slope inward above the waterline, which dramatically reduces RCS by returning much less energy than a conventional flare hull form. The appearance has been compared to that of the historic USS Monitor and her famous antagonist CSS Virginia.\n\nThe class has an integrated power system that can send electricity from its turbo-generators to the electric drive motors or weapons, the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI), automated fire-fighting systems, and automated piping rupture isolation. The class is designed to require a smaller crew and to be less expensive to operate than comparable warships.\n \nThe lead ship is named Zumwalt for Admiral Elmo Zumwalt and carries the hull number DDG-1000. Originally, 32 ships were planned, with $9.6 billion research and development costs spread across the class. As costs overran estimates, the quantity was reduced to 24, then to 7, and finally to 3, significantly increasing the cost per ship to $4.24 billion (excluding R&D costs) and well exceeding the per-unit cost of a nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarine ($2.688 billion). The dramatic per-unit cost increases eventually triggered a Nunn\u2013McCurdy Amendment breach and cancellation of further production.

Six Yuyi-class LCACs are believed to be in service with the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), with the first one (3320) being seen at the end of 2007. It is thought that the vessels were delivered in two batches, with the first three LCACs reportedly powered by Ukrainian UGT 6000 engines, while the remaining three are believed to use the indigenous QC-70 gas turbines. Up to four Yuyi-class LCACs can be carried in the good deck of the 210 m-long Yuzhao-class landing platform dock (LPD).\n\nThe Type 726 LCAC is greater in size than the US LCACs in service, but smaller than the Zubr-class LCAC and can carry only one Type 96 main battle tank or four armored vehicles. With one main battle tank and 60 to 70 troopers on board each LCAC, one LPD is able to send 4 main battle tanks and 300 troopers, i.e. 1 battalion, in one operation.\n\nThe early variant, the Type 726, encountered a number of technical problems that temporarily halted the production of the class. This forced the four Type 071 LPDs to limit their projection capabilities to landing craft, amphibious IFVs, and helicopters exclusively (not main battle tanks). However, recent commercial satellite imagery of China\u2019s Jiangnan Shipyard near Shanghai shows that the country is producing additional Yuyi-class LCACs.

In addition to surveillance and border operations, anti-drug trafficking, environmental protection, and more intense personal threat situations are areas requiring increased efforts. This requires vessels with versatile capabilities. Extreme speed and maneuverability, as well as good loading capacity and crew comfort for longer missions, are important requirements. The IC16M all-aluminum interceptor craft, developed from the CB 90 with Swedish Navy support, has low resistance despite carrying impressive loads, including many troops and weapons.\n\nThe sound-insulated wheelhouse offers excellent visibility around the horizon, and there is space for comfortable accommodation to maximize endurance, especially during longer missions. The combination of low radar profile, extreme speed, and maneuverability creates a powerful platform for police/security operations.\n\nThe crafts low draft, together with a V-shaped hull, provides
