# equipment-db

Starting point for a searchable "equipment database", intended to be a free & open-access option for researchers looking to quickly search for equipment found on satellite imagery.

## To do (in no particular order)
 - [ ] Very basic web UI (a few text boxes, drop downs, and a search button)
 - [ ] Tags (equipment category: function: "Generator", based-on: "KAMAZ 5350", etc.) 
 - [ ] WEFT-style lookup for all equipment ("four wheel, truck", "tracked, apc", "swept wing, jet")
 - [ ] More robust database?
 - [ ] Form for user input (for now, Github Issues?)
 - [ ] Image grid for search results
